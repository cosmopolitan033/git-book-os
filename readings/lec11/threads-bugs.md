### Introduction to Concurrency Problems
- **Keywords:** Concurrency bugs, deadlock, non-deadlock bugs, common patterns.
- **Details:** The document begins with an overview of concurrency bugs, emphasizing the importance of understanding common bug patterns to write robust, concurrent code.

### Types of Concurrency Bugs
- **Keywords:** Atomicity violation bugs, order violation bugs, study by Lu et al., real-world applications.
- **Details:** A significant portion of the document is dedicated to discussing the findings of a study by Lu et al., which analyzes concurrency bugs in major open-source applications like MySQL, Apache, Mozilla, and OpenOffice. The study categorizes bugs into deadlock and non-deadlock types, with the latter being more prevalent.

### Non-Deadlock Bugs
- **Keywords:** Atomicity violation, order violation, real code examples, fixes.
- **Details:** Two major types of non-deadlock bugs are highlighted: atomicity violations and order violations. Examples from real code bases illustrate how these bugs manifest and potential strategies for addressing them, including the use of locks and condition variables.

### Deadlock Bugs
- **Keywords:** Deadlock definition, deadlock conditions, prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery.
- **Details:** The document discusses deadlock bugs, including their definition, conditions leading to deadlock, and various strategies to handle them, such as prevention through lock ordering, avoidance via scheduling, and detection followed by recovery. It stresses the complexity of dealing with deadlocks in large, concurrent systems.

### Summary of Concurrency Bugs
- **Keywords:** Atomicity and order violations, deadlock management, practical tips.
