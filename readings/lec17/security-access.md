The document "Access Control" by Peter Reiher focuses on the concept and implementation of access control mechanisms in operating systems, crucial for enforcing security policies by determining which system resources or services can be accessed by which parties. Here's a structured summary based on the document's content:

### Introduction to Access Control
- **Keywords:** Security goals, policies, actionable software measures, binary decisions.
- **Details:** Access control serves as a foundational step in security, determining if a request aligns with a security policy, leading to either permission or denial of operations.

### The Crux of Access Control
- **Keywords:** Subjects, objects, access modes, authorization, reference monitor.
- **Details:** Discusses the challenge of making access decisions, utilizing a reference monitor for efficient and correct decision-making based on subjects (requesting entities), objects (access targets), and access modes.

### Mechanisms of Access Control
- **Keywords:** Access Control Lists (ACLs), capabilities, system requests, decision algorithms.
- **Details:** Explains the two basic approaches to access control: ACLs, which are lists specifying access permissions on objects, and capabilities, likened to keys or tickets granting access rights to subjects.

### Implementing Access Control
- **Keywords:** Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Details:** Differentiates between DAC (where resource owners define access permissions) and MAC (central authority enforced decisions). Introduces RBAC as a method to assign permissions based on organizational roles, simplifying policy implementation.

### Practical Access Control Considerations
- **Keywords:** Default permissions, privilege escalation, security policy design.
- **Details:** Addresses practical considerations including the setting of default permissions, the management of privilege escalation, and the necessity of well-designed security policies to avoid unintended access.

### Summary and Conclusion
- **Keywords:** Security policy implementation, complete mediation, access control efficiency.
