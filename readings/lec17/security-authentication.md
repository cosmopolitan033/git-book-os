### Introduction to Authentication
- **Keywords:** Security goals, security policies, principal, agent, credential.
- **Details:** Introduces the concept of authentication as a fundamental process for security in operating systems. It emphasizes understanding who is making requests (principal) and the process or entity (agent) performing the request on their behalf, using credentials to support access decisions.

### Attaching Identities to Processes
- **Keywords:** Process creation, identity inheritance, process control block.
- **Details:** Explains the mechanism of attaching identities to processes, typically through inheritance from the creating process, and highlights the security implications of accurately maintaining these identities.

### How to Authenticate Users
- **Keywords:** User authentication, password security, hash functions.
- **Details:** Discusses the classic methods of user authentication based on what users know (passwords), have (tokens or cards), and are (biometrics), focusing on the security measures and challenges associated with each.

### Authentication by What You Know
- **Keywords:** Passwords, hashing, security concerns.
- **Details:** Explores passwords as a method of authentication, detailing the importance of hashing for security and the challenges of ensuring password secrecy and resistance to attacks.

### Authentication by What You Have
- **Keywords:** Security tokens, smart cards, hardware tokens.
- **Details:** Describes authentication methods based on possession, such as security tokens or smart cards, and addresses the challenges of loss and theft.

### Authentication by What You Are
- **Keywords:** Biometrics, false positives, false negatives.
- **Details:** Discusses biometric authentication methods, focusing on the unique challenges they present, including accuracy, reliability, and the need for special hardware.

### Authenticating Non-Humans
- **Keywords:** System users, non-human authentication, sudo command.
- **Details:** Addresses the concept of authenticating processes that do not have a human user, such as system services or automated tasks, and the methods for securely managing their identities.

### Summary
- **Keywords:** Process identity, multi-factor authentication, security policies.
