### Introduction to Cryptography
- **Keywords:** Cryptography, data protection, operating system limitations.
- **Details:** Highlights the necessity of cryptography as a means to secure data beyond the control of the operating system, stressing that cryptography is crucial for protecting data across different machines and systems.

### The Crux of Cryptography
- **Keywords:** Encryption, decryption, keys, confidentiality, data integrity.
- **Details:** Describes the fundamental process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using encryption algorithms and keys, and the reverse process for decryption, emphasizing the importance of key secrecy for effective cryptography.

### Using Cryptography Outside the OS Domain
- **Keywords:** Cryptographic technologies, applications, limitations.
- **Details:** Explores the application of cryptography to secure information outside the operating system's domain, addressing the challenges of correctly implementing and using cryptographic technologies.

### Public Key Cryptography
- **Keywords:** Public key, private key, asymmetric encryption, authentication.
- **Details:** Introduces public key cryptography as a solution for key distribution problems, allowing secure communication and authentication without shared secret keys.

### Cryptographic Hashes
- **Keywords:** Cryptographic hashes, data integrity, hash functions.
- **Details:** Discusses the use of cryptographic hashes to ensure data integrity by providing a way to verify that data has not been tampered with, highlighting the importance of hashing for secure information storage and transmission.

### Cracking Cryptography
- **Keywords:** Key secrecy, brute force attacks, cryptographic standards.
- **Details:** Addresses the concerns about the potential for cryptography to be cracked, emphasizing that the main vulnerability lies in key management rather than the cryptographic algorithms themselves.

### Cryptography and Operating Systems
- **Keywords:** Data encryption, key management, at-rest data encryption.
- **Details:** Examines the role of cryptography within operating systems, focusing on scenarios where encryption can protect data, such as data at rest and data in transit, while acknowledging the limitations imposed by key management challenges.

### At-Rest Data Encryption
- **Keywords:** Full disk encryption, mobile device security, data protection.
- **Details:** Details the benefits and limitations of at-rest data encryption, particularly full disk encryption, as a means to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access when hardware devices are compromised or stolen.

### Cryptographic Capabilities
- **Keywords:** Capabilities, access control, encryption schemes.
- **Details:** Explores the concept of cryptographic capabilities as an advanced form of access control, where encryption ensures that capabilities cannot be forged, enhancing the security of distributed systems.
