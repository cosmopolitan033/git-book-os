# VM Introduction

### Early Systems and the Advent of Multiprogramming
- **Keywords:** Early computing, physical memory, OS as a library, multiprogramming.
- **Details:** Initially, computers didn't offer much abstraction in terms of memory, essentially presenting physical memory as is to the user. The document outlines the evolution from these simplistic systems to more complex multiprogramming environments, which allowed multiple processes to be ready for execution, increasing CPU utilization and system efficiency.

### The Emergence of Time Sharing
- **Keywords:** Time sharing, batch computing, interactivity, programmer productivity.
- **Details:** The document discusses the transition to time-sharing systems, driven by the need for more interactive computing experiences and efficient use of expensive computing resources. Time sharing introduced the concept of allowing multiple users to interact with a computer simultaneously, significantly impacting programmer productivity and user experience.

### Virtual Memory and Address Spaces
- **Keywords:** Virtual memory, address space, process memory state, code, stack, heap.
- **Details:** Virtual memory is introduced as an abstraction that provides each process with the illusion of having its own private physical memory. This section explains the structure of a process's address space, which includes the program's code, stack, and heap, and how these elements are managed within the virtual memory system.

### The Role of the Operating System
- **Keywords:** Virtualizing memory, transparency, efficiency, protection.
- **Details:** The operating system's responsibility in virtualizing memory is emphasized, focusing on goals like transparency (making the virtualization invisible to running programs), efficiency (minimizing the performance impact of virtualization), and protection (ensuring processes cannot interfere with each other's memory).

### Mechanisms and Policies for Virtual Memory
- **Keywords:** Free space management, page replacement, hardware support, TLBs.
- **Details:** The document sets the stage for exploring the mechanisms and policies necessary for implementing an effective virtual memory system, including managing free space, deciding which pages to evict when memory is low, and the role of hardware support like TLBs in facilitating efficient address translation.

### Summary
- **Keywords:** Virtual memory system, address space illusion, physical memory virtualization.
