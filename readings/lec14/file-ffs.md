# The Fast File System (FFS)

## Detailed Outline and Key Knowledge Points

### 1. Locality and The Fast File System
- **Keywords:** UNIX, Ken Thompson, old file system, simplicity, poor performance.
- **Details:** Discusses the simplicity and inherent performance issues of the initial UNIX file system created by Ken Thompson, emphasizing its poor handling of disk bandwidth and lack of efficiency in data management.

### 2. The Problem: Poor Performance
- **Keywords:** Performance degradation, disk random-access, expensive seeks, fragmentation, free space management.
- **Details:** Highlights the major performance issues of the old UNIX file system, including inefficient data placement and management leading to significant disk fragmentation and reduced disk bandwidth utilization.

### 3. FFS: Disk Awareness Is The Solution
- **Keywords:** Berkeley, Fast File System (FFS), disk-aware, performance improvement, file system research, API compatibility.
- **Details:** Introduces the development of the Fast File System (FFS) at Berkeley, focusing on its disk-aware design to significantly improve performance while maintaining compatibility with existing file system APIs.

### 4. Organizing Structure: The Cylinder Group
- **Keywords:** Cylinder groups, hard drive tracks, logical address space, block groups, inode allocation, super block.
- **Details:** Describes the organizational structure of FFS, including the division of the disk into cylinder groups to optimize data placement and access, and the introduction of block groups for modern file systems.

### 5. FFS File Creation
- **Keywords:** File creation process, inode bitmap, data bitmap, directory updates, write operations.
- **Details:** Outlines the process of file creation in FFS, detailing the updates to inode and data bitmaps, and the necessary steps to integrate new files into the directory hierarchy, emphasizing the complexity of write operations.

### 6. Policies: How To Allocate Files and Directories
- **Keywords:** Allocation heuristics, directory placement, file allocation, minimizing seeks, data separation.
- **Details:** Discusses the allocation policies of FFS, including heuristics for placing files and directories to minimize disk seeks and improve performance by keeping related data together.

### 7. Measuring File Locality
- **Keywords:** SEER traces, namespace locality, file access patterns, directory tree distance metric.
- **Details:** Analyzes file access patterns using SEER traces to validate the assumption of namespace locality in FFS, demonstrating the effectiveness of its data organization strategies.

### 8. The Large-File Exception
- **Keywords:** Large file handling, block group filling, file-access locality, chunk allocation, amortization.
- **Details:** Explains the special handling of large files in FFS to avoid overwhelming single block groups, detailing the strategy of distributing large file chunks across multiple groups to balance performance and locality.

### 9. A Few Other Things About FFS
- **Keywords:** Small files, sub-blocks, internal fragmentation, disk layout optimization, parameterized placement, usability features.
- **Details:** Covers additional innovations in FFS, such as the introduction of sub-blocks for small files to reduce waste, optimization of disk layout for performance, and usability improvements including long file names and symbolic links.

### 10. Summary
- **Keywords:** FFS impact, disk-aware layout, usability features, modern file systems.
