# Threads - Locks Usage

### Introduction to Concurrent Data Structures
- **Keywords:** Concurrent data structures, thread safety, locks, performance.
- **Details:** Introduces the concept of making data structures thread-safe through the addition of locks, emphasizing the balance between correctness and performance.

### Concurrent Counters
- **Keywords:** Simple counter, synchronization, performance issues.
- **Details:** Discusses the implementation of thread-safe counters using locks to ensure atomic increments and decrements, highlighting potential performance bottlenecks in highly concurrent scenarios.

### Scalable Counters
- **Keywords:** Scalable counters, approximate counters, local and global counters.
- **Details:** Explores strategies for designing counters that scale with the number of threads, such as using approximate counting techniques to reduce lock contention.

### Concurrent Linked Lists
- **Keywords:** Linked list, lock acquisition, exceptional control flow.
- **Details:** Covers the implementation of a concurrent linked list, detailing the use of locks to protect list operations and addressing challenges related to error-prone control flows in concurrent environments.

### Concurrent Queues
- **Keywords:** Michael and Scott's queue, dummy node, enqueue and dequeue.
- **Details:** Examines a more concurrent queue design that utilizes separate locks for the head and tail to enable higher concurrency between enqueue and dequeue operations.

### Concurrent Hash Tables
- **Keywords:** Hash table, lock per bucket, scalable performance.
- **Details:** Describes the implementation of a concurrent hash table that uses a lock per hash bucket to allow many concurrent operations, resulting in significantly improved performance over single-lock approaches.

### Performance and Optimization Tips
- **Keywords:** Premature optimization, simple schemes, measuring performance.
