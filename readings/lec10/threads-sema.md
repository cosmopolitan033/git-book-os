# Threads - Semaphores

### Introduction to Semaphores
- **Keywords:** Edsger Dijkstra, semaphore, synchronization, locks, condition variables.
- **Details:** Introduces semaphores as a primitive introduced by Edsger Dijkstra for synchronization in concurrent programming, capable of functioning as both locks and condition variables.

### Semaphores: A Definition
- **Keywords:** `sem_wait()`, `sem_post()`, POSIX standard, initialization.
- **Details:** Defines a semaphore as an object with an integer value manipulated by two routines: `sem_wait()` for decrementing the semaphore and possibly blocking, and `sem_post()` for incrementing the semaphore and potentially waking waiting threads.

### Binary Semaphores (Locks)
- **Keywords:** Binary semaphore, critical section, lock, semaphore initialization.
- **Details:** Discusses using semaphores as binary locks by initializing the semaphore to 1, ensuring mutual exclusion in critical sections through `sem_wait()` and `sem_post()` operations.

### Semaphores for Ordering
- **Keywords:** Ordering, `sem_init()`, parent-child synchronization.
- **Details:** Explores the use of semaphores for controlling execution order, such as synchronizing the execution sequence between parent and child threads, with semaphores initialized to control the waiting and signaling mechanism effectively.

### The Producer/Consumer (Bounded Buffer) Problem
- **Keywords:** Producer/consumer problem, bounded buffer, semaphores for synchronization.
- **Details:** Applies semaphores to solve the producer/consumer problem by managing empty and full states with semaphores, highlighting their utility in coordinating producer and consumer actions to avoid race conditions and ensure proper access to a shared buffer.

### Reader-Writer Locks
- **Keywords:** Reader-writer locks, concurrent read access, exclusive write access, semaphore implementation.
- **Details:** Implements reader-writer locks using semaphores to allow multiple readers or a single writer access to a shared resource, addressing the challenge of balancing concurrency and mutual exclusion for different types of accesses.

### Thread Throttling
- **Keywords:** Throttling, semaphore value as admission control, avoiding system overload.
- **Details:** Describes the use of semaphores for throttling to limit the number of threads executing a particular piece of code concurrently, preventing system overload by controlling access to resource-intensive sections of code.

### How to Implement Semaphores
- **Keywords:** Zemaphores, locks, condition variables, semaphore implementation.
- **Details:** Provides an example of implementing semaphores, dubbed "Zemaphores," using locks and condition variables to illustrate how low-level synchronization primitives can construct semaphores.

### Summary
- **Keywords:** Concurrency control, semaphore usage, classic problems, synchronization primitives.
