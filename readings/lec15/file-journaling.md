# Journaling File Systems

## Summary and Key Knowledge Points

### Crash Consistency: FSCK and Journaling
- **Keywords:** Persistent data structures, power loss, system crash, crash-consistency problem.
- **Details:** Introduces the concept of crash consistency in file systems, highlighting the challenges posed by power losses or system crashes during updates to on-disk structures.

### The Crash Consistency Problem
- **Keywords:** Inconsistent state, atomicity, transactional updates.
- **Details:** Describes scenarios where file system updates can leave on-disk structures in an inconsistent state due to crashes, emphasizing the need for atomicity in updates.

### Solution #1: The File System Checker (fsck)
- **Keywords:** fsck, inconsistencies repair, sanity checks, allocated blocks.
- **Details:** Explores the role of fsck in identifying and repairing inconsistencies within file systems post-crash, including checks on superblocks, free blocks, inode state, and directory integrity.

### Solution #2: Journaling (or Write-Ahead Logging)
- **Keywords:** Journaling, write-ahead logging, transactional updates, recovery.
- **Details:** Discusses journaling as a proactive strategy to maintain crash consistency by logging updates before applying them to the file system, facilitating easier recovery from crashes.

#### A Detailed Example
- **Keywords:** Workload, on-disk structures update, transaction, recovery scenarios.
- **Details:** Provides a detailed example of how journaling works, including the logging of transactions before applying updates to on-disk structures and recovery scenarios following a crash.

#### Data Journaling
- **Keywords:** Data and metadata journaling, transactional integrity, checkpointing.
- **Details:** Explores data journaling where both data and metadata changes are logged before being applied, ensuring consistency but doubling write traffic.

#### Metadata Journaling
- **Keywords:** Metadata-only journaling, ordered writes, data write precedency.
- **Details:** Focuses on metadata-only journaling, where only metadata updates are journaled, reducing I/O load but requiring careful ordering of data writes to ensure consistency.

### Other Approaches to Crash Consistency
- **Keywords:** Soft Updates, copy-on-write (COW), backpointer-based consistency (BBC), optimistic crash consistency.
- **Details:** Presents alternative methods for achieving crash consistency, including Soft Updates, COW techniques as seen in ZFS, BBC for lazy crash consistency, and optimistic protocols for reducing waiting times on disk writes.

### Summary
- **Keywords:** fsck limitations, journaling benefits, metadata consistency, recovery efficiency.
