# Threads and Locks

### Introduction to Locks
- **Keywords:** Mutual exclusion, critical sections, hardware interrupts, atomicity.
- **Details:** Discusses the necessity of locks for achieving mutual exclusion in critical sections of concurrent programs, particularly in the presence of hardware interrupts and multiple processors.

### Basic Lock Mechanisms
- **Keywords:** Lock variable, lock acquisition, lock release, mutual exclusion.
- **Details:** Introduces the basic mechanism of locks through lock acquisition (`lock()`) and release (`unlock()`) functions, using a lock variable to indicate the lock state.

### Evaluating Locks
- **Keywords:** Mutual exclusion, fairness, performance, contention.
- **Details:** Evaluates locks based on their ability to ensure mutual exclusion, fairness in lock acquisition among threads, and the performance impact, especially under high contention.

### Spin Locks and Their Implementation
- **Keywords:** Spin-waiting, test-and-set, atomic operations, spinning inefficiency.
- **Details:** Describes spin locks and their implementation using the test-and-set hardware primitive, highlighting the problem of inefficiency due to CPU cycle waste in spin-waiting.

### Advanced Lock Mechanisms
- **Keywords:** Compare-and-swap, load-linked/store-conditional, ticket locks, fetch-and-add.
- **Details:** Explores more advanced lock mechanisms using hardware primitives like compare-and-swap and load-linked/store-conditional, and introduces ticket locks and their implementation using the fetch-and-add instruction for improved fairness.

### Avoiding Spin-Waiting
- **Keywords:** Yielding, scheduler cooperation, OS support, park/unpark primitives.
- **Details:** Discusses strategies to avoid the inefficiency of spin-waiting by yielding CPU control, requiring cooperation from the scheduler and operating system support through primitives like park() and unpark().

### Real-World Lock Implementations
- **Keywords:** Linux futexes, atomic operations, two-phase locks, system call support.
- **Details:** Examines real-world lock implementations, such as Linux futexes, that use atomic operations and operating system support to efficiently manage lock acquisition and release, including strategies to avoid unnecessary spinning.

### Summary
- **Keywords:** Locks, hardware support, operating system support, mutual exclusion.
