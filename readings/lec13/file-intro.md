# Introduction to File Systems

### Introduction to File Systems
- **Keywords:** Process virtualization, memory virtualization, persistent storage, hard disk drives, solid-state storage devices.
- **Details:** Discusses how operating systems virtualize CPU and memory to create isolated execution environments for programs. Introduces persistent storage as a crucial part of this virtualization puzzle, emphasizing its importance in storing data permanently, unlike volatile memory.

### Files and Directories
- **Keywords:** File abstraction, directory structure, inode numbers, directory hierarchy.
- **Details:** Explains files as linear arrays of bytes with associated low-level names (inode numbers) and directories as special files that list name and inode number pairs, allowing users to organize files within a hierarchical structure.

### Naming and File System Interface
- **Keywords:** Naming conventions, file system API, UNIX file systems.
- **Details:** Highlights the significance of naming in computing systems and introduces the file system interface, focusing on UNIX file systems and operations like creating, accessing, and deleting files.

### Creating and Managing Files
- **Keywords:** File creation, open system call, file descriptors, reading and writing files.
- **Details:** Describes the process of creating files using the `open` system call and managing file access through file descriptors. Details the operations for reading and writing files, including the use of system calls like `read` and `write`.

### Caching and Buffering
- **Keywords:** Performance optimization, memory usage, data buffering.
- **Details:** Discusses the role of caching and buffering in file systems to improve performance by minimizing disk I/O operations.

### Sequential and Random Access
- **Keywords:** `lseek` system call, file offsets, random access.
- **Details:** Explains how files can be accessed both sequentially and randomly, with the `lseek` system call enabling movement to specific offsets within a file for reading or writing.

### Shared File Table Entries
- **Keywords:** `fork`, `dup`, open file table, process file descriptors.
- **Details:** Covers how file table entries are shared among processes, particularly after a `fork`, and the role of the `dup` system call in duplicating file descriptors.

### File System Operations
- **Keywords:** `fsync`, file renaming, metadata, `stat` system call.
- **Details:** Explores various file system operations, including forcing immediate writes with `fsync`, renaming files, and accessing file metadata through the `stat` system call.

### Hard and Symbolic Links
- **Keywords:** Hard links, symbolic links, inode reference count, link management.
- **Details:** Differentiates between hard and symbolic links, discussing how they reference file data and the implications for file management and deletion.
