# Introduction to Operating Systems

### Introduction to Operating Systems
- **Keywords:** Computer program execution, Von Neumann model.
- **Details:** The document starts with the basics of how a computer program executes instructions millions of times per second, setting the stage for discussing the complex functionalities an OS performs to make the system easy to use.

### The Crux of the Problem: How to Virtualize Resources
- **Keywords:** Virtualization, resources, mechanisms, policies, hardware support.
- **Details:** Central to the document is the exploration of how the OS virtualizes physical resources like the processor, memory, or disk into more general, powerful, and easy-to-use virtual forms, highlighting the mechanisms and policies employed to achieve efficient virtualization.

### Operating Systems as Virtual Machines
- **Keywords:** Virtualization technique, interfaces (APIs), system calls.
- **Details:** It describes the OS as a virtual machine that transforms physical resources into virtual forms, offering a few hundred system calls to applications for interacting with these resources.

### Resource Management
- **Keywords:** CPU, memory, disk, resource manager.
- **Details:** The OS's role as a resource manager is outlined, managing the CPU, memory, and disk as shared resources and distributing them efficiently or fairly among processes.

### Practical Examples
- **Keywords:** Process execution, memory access, concurrency, persistence.
- **Details:** Through practical code examples, the document illustrates how the OS manages process execution, memory access, and the challenges of concurrency. It also introduces the concept of persistence, emphasizing the importance of storing data persistently using file systems and I/O devices.

### Design Goals and History
- **Keywords:** Abstraction, performance, protection, reliability, security, energy-efficiency, mobility.
- **Details:** Discusses the design goals of an operating system, including the provision of abstractions, performance optimization, and ensuring protection and reliability. It also touches on the historical development of operating systems, from simple libraries to complex systems that manage multiprogramming and provide rich features.

### Summary and Homework
- **Keywords:** Virtualization, concurrency, persistence, homework exercises.
