# TLBs

### Introduction to TLBs
- **Keywords:** Address translation, TLB, virtual memory, paging overhead, memory-management unit (MMU).
- **Details:** Introduces the concept of TLBs as a hardware cache within the MMU, designed to speed up the translation from virtual to physical addresses by caching popular address translations, thus avoiding costly page table lookups for each memory access.

### TLB Basic Algorithm
- **Keywords:** Virtual page number (VPN), TLB lookup, TLB hit, TLB miss, page frame number (PFN), page table entry (PTE).
- **Details:** Describes the algorithm for handling virtual address translations through TLBs, including the process of extracting the VPN, performing a TLB lookup, and actions taken on TLB hits versus misses. Emphasizes the importance of efficiently handling TLB misses by consulting the page table only when necessary.

### TLB Performance and Spatial Locality
- **Keywords:** TLB hit rate, spatial locality, page size, temporal locality.
- **Details:** Discusses the performance impact of TLBs on memory access times, highlighting how spatial and temporal locality contribute to higher TLB hit rates. Illustrates with examples how accessing closely located data (spatial locality) within the same page can lead to improved TLB performance.

### TLB Miss Handling: Hardware vs. Software
- **Keywords:** Hardware-managed TLBs, software-managed TLBs, TLB miss handling, exception raising, page table walking.
- **Details:** Examines two approaches to TLB miss handlingâ€”hardware and software. In hardware-managed systems, the hardware automatically walks the page table to resolve misses. In contrast, software-managed systems raise an exception to let the operating system handle the miss, offering more flexibility and simplicity in managing the page table.

### TLB Contents and Structure
- **Keywords:** Fully associative, VPN, PFN, valid bit, protection bits, address-space identifier (ASID), dirty bit.
- **Details:** Provides an overview of the structure of TLB entries, including the VPN, PFN, and various control bits such as the valid bit, protection bits, and possibly an ASID for differentiating translations across processes.

### Context Switches and TLB Management
- **Keywords:** Context switch, address-space separation, TLB flushing, address space identifier (ASID).
- **Details:** Addresses the challenge of managing TLB contents across context switches between processes, exploring solutions like TLB flushing and the use of ASIDs to maintain separate address spaces without the need for constant TLB clearing.

### TLB Replacement Policy
- **Keywords:** Cache replacement, least-recently-used (LRU), random replacement, TLB entry eviction.
- **Details:** Discusses strategies for replacing TLB entries when the TLB is full, weighing the benefits of LRU and random replacement policies in maintaining an optimal hit rate.

### Real-World TLB Example
- **Keywords:** MIPS R4000, software-managed TLB, TLB entry structure, global bit, coherence bits.
- **Details:** Offers a glimpse into a real-world example of a TLB from the MIPS R4000 processor, detailing its software-managed approach and specific entry fields such as the global bit and coherence bits.

### Summary
- **Keywords:** TLB optimization, memory access performance, virtual memory.
