# Threads Introduction

### Introduction to Concurrency and Threads
- **Keywords:** CPU virtualization, memory virtualization, threads, process execution, program counter (PC).
- **Details:** Introduces threads as a means to advance the concept of concurrency within a single process, allowing multiple points of execution (multiple PCs) that share the same address space. This approach enables programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, akin to running multiple programs concurrently.

### Why Use Threads?
- **Keywords:** Parallelism, blocking I/O, performance, efficiency.
- **Details:** Discusses the major reasons for using threads, including achieving parallelism on multi-processor systems for computational speedup and improving program efficiency by allowing other threads to execute while one is blocked on I/O operations.

### Thread Creation Example
- **Keywords:** `pthread_create()`, `pthread_join()`, thread function execution, synchronization.
- **Details:** Provides an example of creating threads using the POSIX Threads library (`pthreads`), where each thread executes a simple function. The example illustrates how threads can run independently and may complete in any order, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of concurrent execution.

### The Problem of Shared Data
- **Keywords:** Shared variables, race conditions, critical sections, mutual exclusion.
- **Details:** Explores the challenges associated with threads accessing shared data, leading to race conditions and indeterminate program behavior. Highlights the need for synchronization mechanisms to ensure mutual exclusion in critical sections for correctness.

### Atomicity and Synchronization Primitives
- **Keywords:** Atomic operations, hardware support, synchronization primitives, building multi-threaded code.
- **Details:** Describes the role of atomic operations provided by hardware and the operating system in developing synchronization primitives. These primitives enable controlled access to shared resources, ensuring the correct execution of concurrent code.

### Waiting for Other Threads
- **Keywords:** Sleeping/waking, condition variables, inter-thread communication.
- **Details:** Introduces another common pattern in concurrent programming where threads need to wait for actions by other threads before proceeding, necessitating mechanisms for efficiently sleeping and waking threads based on certain conditions.

### Summary and Motivation
- **Keywords:** Concurrency in OS, critical sections, race conditions, mutual exclusion, efficient CPU usage.
