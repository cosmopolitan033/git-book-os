# Threads API

### Introduction to Thread API
- **Keywords:** pthreads, thread creation, control, synchronization.
- **Details:** Outlines the purpose of the pthreads library in offering a set of interfaces for creating and managing threads, emphasizing the importance of these APIs in enabling concurrent execution within applications.

### Thread Creation
- **Keywords:** `pthread_create`, function pointers, thread attributes.
- **Details:** Describes the `pthread_create` function used to spawn new threads, detailing its parameters including the thread identifier, attributes, the start routine, and the argument to the start routine. The section explains the significance of function pointers in defining the execution start point for new threads.

### Thread Completion
- **Keywords:** `pthread_join`, thread termination, return values.
- **Details:** Focuses on how to wait for a thread to complete its execution using `pthread_join`, which allows a thread to wait for another to terminate and optionally capture its return value. This mechanism is crucial for synchronization between threads, especially when the completion of one thread is a prerequisite for another's operation.

### Locks for Mutual Exclusion
- **Keywords:** `pthread_mutex_lock`, `pthread_mutex_unlock`, critical sections.
- **Details:** Discusses the use of mutex locks to ensure mutual exclusion in critical sections of code, preventing concurrent threads from executing certain parts of code simultaneously. It highlights the functions `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` for acquiring and releasing locks, respectively.

### Condition Variables for Synchronization
- **Keywords:** `pthread_cond_wait`, `pthread_cond_signal`, signaling.
- **Details:** Explores condition variables as a mechanism for blocking a thread until a particular condition is true, with `pthread_cond_wait` for waiting on a condition and `pthread_cond_signal` for signaling another thread that a condition has changed, facilitating finer-grained synchronization between threads.

### Compiling and Running pthreads Programs
- **Keywords:** Compilation, `-pthread`, linking pthreads library.
- **Details:** Provides guidance on compiling programs that use the pthreads library, including the necessity of linking the pthreads library by adding `-pthread` to the compilation command.

### Summary and Best Practices
- **Keywords:** Thread safety, error checking, argument passing.
