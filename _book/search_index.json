Introduction\nWe build increasingly large amounts of increasingly complex software. Size and complexity create numerous problems:\n\nincreasingly sophisticated software means that the typical project involves multiple orders of magnitude more code than projects of 20-30 years ago.\nincreasing complexity means that the work involved in creating a piece of software is much worse than linear with the number of lines of code involved.\nincreasing complexity makes it very difficult to learn and fully understand our software, which leads to many more errors in its construction.\nsystems are now assembled from numerous independently developed and delivered pieces, and small changes in one component often result in failures of other components.\nas the number of independent interacting components increases, we begin to see complex emergent behaviors that could not have been predicted from our experience with smaller systems.\nincreasingly rich functionality and interactions with increasingly many other external systems make complete testing combinatorically impossible.\nour increasing dependency on this software means that failures will cause more severe problems, for more people, more often.\n\nWe need tools and techniques to tame this complexity. Without such tools, we cannot deliver today's software ... much less tomorrow's.\nOperating systems have long been among the largest and complex pieces of software:\n\nThey involve complex interactions among many sub-systems.\nThey involve numerous asynchronous interactions and externally originated events.\nThey involve the sharing of stateful resources among cooperating parallel processes.\nThey involve coordinated actions among heterogenous components in large distributed systems.\nThey must evolve to meet ever-changing requirements.\nThey must be able to run, without error, for years, despite the regular failures of all components.\nThey must be portable to virtually all computer architectures and able to function in heterogenous environments (with many different versions of many different implementations, on many different platforms).\n\nFew of these problems are unique to operating systems, but operating systems encountered them sooner and more intensely than other software domains. As a result, these problems have come to be best understood and solutions developed in the context of Operating Systems. When evolving disciplines encounter these problems, they commonly go back to see how they have been characterized and solved within operating systems.\n2. Complexity Management Principles\nSoftware Engineering has developed numerous tools to help us manage the complexity of large software projects. Many of these are software development and project management techniques, but there are also several fundamental design principles.\n2.1 Layered Structure and Hierarchical Decomposition\nA complex system can easily have too many components and interactions to be held in a single mind, at a single time. To make the whole system (or even individual components) understandable, we must break the system down into smaller components that can be understood individually.\nHierarchical decomposition is the process of decomposing a system in a top-down fashion. If we wanted to describe the University of California, we might\n\nStart by dividing it into the Regents, the Office of the President, and the campuses.\nThe campuses can be divided into ten university campuses (UCLA, UCSB, ...) and three laboratories (Livermore, Los Alamos, ...)\nOne campus (e.g. UCLA) can be divided into administration and schools (Letters and Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, ...)\nAdministration can be divided into departments (personnel, legal, finance, registrar, deans, ...)\nEach School (e.g. Engineering) can also be divided into departments (Computer Science, Materials, ...)\nA department can be divided into administrative staff, support staff, and faculty\nAdministrative staff can be divided into responsibility areas (payroll, purchasing, personnel, ...) ...\n\nAt each level we can talk about the mission of each group and interactions with other groups. In this way we are understanding a huge University system one layer at a time. We can also pick a particular group and look at (decompose it into) the sub-groups that comprise it. In this way we can develop an understanding of that one group, without having to understand the internal structure of all the groups with which it interacts. Both of these approaches give us the opportunity to develop (some) understanding of the University in small installments.\nHierarchical decomposition is not merely a technique for studying existing systems, but also a principle for designing new systems. If every person in any part of the University system interacted regularly with every other person in every other part, the processes would be impossible to understand or manage. But if we can devise a structure where, at each level, there is a clear division of responsibilities among components, and most functions can be carried out within a particular component, the responsibilities and relationships are much simplified, and it becomes possible to understand, and to manage the system.\nHierarchical structure is a very effective approach to designing or understanding complex systems. But the operation of these systems is not always strictly hierarchical. If we drill down into the details, we see that not all interaction is constrained to follow the tree. Course planning involves interactions between departmental administration and the registrar's office. Different departments or schools often work together to create programs and events in areas of shared interest. The Academic Senate is comprised of department faculty, but their decisions may have implications for the entire system. Such cross-communication is common in hierarchically structured systems. But, as we will see below, there may be advantages to trying to minimize non-hierarchical communication.\nThis principle has been described in terms of a University system. But it is highly applicable to complex software systems. In this course we will study and observe the hierarchical design of a complex modern operating system.\n2.2 Modularity and Functional Encapsulation\nTaking a few million people and arbitrarily assigning them to groups of ten, and then arbitrarily assigning those groups into super-groups of one hundred ... would not be sufficient to make the system understandable or manageable. We must also require that:\n\nEach group/component (at each level) have a coherent purpose.\nMost functions (for which a particular group is responsible) can be performed entirely within that group/component.\nThe union of the groups/component (within each super-group/system) is able to achieve the system's purpose.\n\nThese requirements are the difference between an arbitrary decomposition and a hierarchical decomposition. Such a decomposition makes it possible to opaquely encapsulate the internal operation of a sub-group/component, and to view it only in terms of its external interfaces (the services it performs for other groups/components). This enables us to look a group in two very different ways:\n\nWe can examine its responsibilities, and its role in the system of which it is a part.\nWe can examine the internal structure and operating rules by which it fulfills its responsibilities.\n\nAs long as a component is able to effectively fulfill its responsibilities, external managers and clients can ignore the internal structure and operating rules. Moreover, it should be possible to change the internal structure and operating rules without impacting external clients and managers. When it is possible to understand and use the functions of a component without understanding its internal structure, we call that component a module and say that its implementation details are encapsulated within that module. When a system is designed so that all of its components have this characteristic, we say that the system design is modular.\nWe can go a little further in defining the characteristics of good modularity:\n\nThere are numerous ways to break up the responsibilities of a system. Smaller and simpler components are easier to understand and manage than larger and more complex components. Thus, there are clear benefits to dividing a system into a larger number of smaller and simpler components. Going back to the university example, even though the University has over a thousand departments and a hundred-thousand employees, it is not particularly difficult to understand the role and responsibilities of any particular department or administrator.\n\n\nMany functions are closely related, typically because they perform related operations on the same resources. If operations on a single resource (e.g. deposits and withdrawals in a bank account) are implemented in separate components, there is a danger that a change in one component might (through unintended side effects) break another component. Thus it is a good idea to combine closely related functionality (operations embodying common understandings, or with a high likelihood of affecting one-another) into a single module. Combining this with the previous characteristic: we want the smallest possible modules consistent with the co-location of closely related functionality. This characteristic of modular design is called cohesion, and a module that exhibits this characteristic is said to be cohesive.\n\n\nThere are numerous ways to apportion the functionality of a system among its components. If most operations can be accomplished entirely within a single component, they are likely to be accomplished more efficiently. If many operations involve exchanges of services between components:\n\nthe overhead of communication between components may reduce system efficiency.\nthe increased number of interfaces to service those inter-component requests increases the complexity of the system and the opportunity for misunderstandings.\nincreased dependencies between components increase the likelihood of errors or misunderstandings.\n\nThus, the scope of component responsibilities must be designed with an eye towards how well it will be possible to compartmentalize operations within that component. This is another type of\n\n\n  cohesion\n  . As observed above, there are surely many interactions between various administrators, but most of the day-to-day operations and communications for the personnel administrator in the UCLA Computer Science department are with other people in that department.\nIn this course, we will observe the way in which a modern operating system is structured and how responsibility is apportioned among sub-systems and plug-in components.\n2.3 Appropriately Abstracted Interfaces and Information Hiding\nThere are numerous ways to specify the interface for each piece of component functionality. They are not all equally good. It seems natural (for an implementer) to define interfaces that mate easily with an intended implementation. A faucet, for instance, delivers water at a rate and temperature that is controlled by a chosen mixture of hot and cold water. So it is that, for many years, most faucets have had two valves (for hot and cold water). While this interface is very easy for plumbers to hook up, it is not a particularly good one:\n\nI, as a user, want a certain flow of water at a certain temperature. I do not want to guess at the (changing over time) amounts of hot and cold water that will provide it for me. An interface that enables a client to specify parameters that are most meaningful to them and easily get the desired results is said to embody appropriate abstraction. An interface that does not provide a client with what they want is said to be poorly abstracted.\n\nThe two-valve interface is tightly coupled to a hot- and cold-water supply implementation. If water temperature was controlled by a local flash-heater (or flash-cooler), a two-valve set of controls would be both awkward and inefficient to implement. An appropriately abstracted interface that does not reveal the underlying implementation is said to be opaque and to exhibit good information hiding (not exposing implementation details that clients did not want to be forced to understand).\n\nTwo separate controls for temperature and flow rate would more opaquely encapsulate the water delivery mechanisms. Changing the temperature control from a simple clockwise-hot knob to a temperature-calibrated dial would create a much more convenient control abstraction for the intended uses. Such an interface better serves the clients, and provides greater flexibility to the implementers.\nObviously a better abstracted interface is easier for the intended clients. But even if the internal implementation was well suited to the intended clients, exposing implementation details would:\n\nexpose more complexity to the client, making the interface more difficult to describe/learn.\nlimit the provider's flexibility to change the interface in the future, because the previously exposed interface included many aspects of the implementation. A different implementation would expose clients to an incompatible interface.\n\nIn this course, we will examine many fundamental abstractions of software services and resources, how well those interfaces serve their clients and the need for evolution.\n2.4 Powerful Abstractions\nIf every problem has to be solved from scratch, every problem will be hard to solve, and progress will be slow and difficult. But if we can draw on a library of powerful tools, we may find that most problems are easily solved by existing tools. Most of classical mechanics is based on a few basic machines (wheel, lever, inclined plane, screw, pulley, ...) and tools (hammer, chisel, saw, drill, ... ). These are not merely artifacts we can employ to build new inventions; They actually set the terms in which we visualize our problems. A new technique or tool (e.g. constructive fabrication with 3D-printers) can radically alter the way we approach problems and (perhaps more importantly) the problems we can solve.\nUnlike basic machines and tools (which we can observe in nature), virtually all of the tools and resources in an operating system are abstract concepts from the imaginations of system architects. As operating systems have evolved, we continue to devise more powerful abstractions. A powerful abstraction is one that can be profitably applied to many situations:\n\ncommon paradigms (e.g. lock granularity, cache coherency, bottlenecks) that enable us to more easily understand a wide range of phenomena.\ncommon architectures (e.g. federations of plug-in modules treating all data sources as files) that can be used as fundamental models for new solutions.\ncommon mechanisms (e.g. registries, remote procedure calls) in terms of which we can visualize and construct solutions\n\nSufficiently powerful abstractions give us tools to understand, organize and control systems which would otherwise be intractably complex. In this course we will study the emergent phenomena in large and complex systems, concepts in terms of which those phenomena can be understood, and abstractions in terms of which they can be managed.\n2.5 Interface Contracts\nA complex system is composed of many interacting components. Hierarchical decomposition and modular information hiding moves our attention from implementations to interfaces. Every system, sub-system, or component is primarily understood in terms of the services it provides and the interfaces through which it provides them. An interface specification is a contract: a promise to deliver specific results, in specific forms, in response to requests in specific forms. If the service-providing component operates according to the interface specification, and the clients ensure that all use is within the scope of the interface specifications, then the system should work, no matter what changes are made to the individual component implementations.\nThese contracts do not merely specify what we will do today, but they represent a commitment for what will be done in the future. This is particularly important in large, complex systems like an operating system. An operating system will be used for a relatively long time, and is assembled from thousands of components developed by thousands of people, most of whom are operating independently from one-another. Technologies and requirements are continuously evolving and component implementations change continuously in response. If a new version of a service-providing component does not fully comply with its interface specifications (e.g. we decide to change the order of the parameters to the open(2) system call), or a new client uses a component in an out-of-spec way (e.g. exploiting an undocumented feature), problems are likely to arise, in the future, perhaps resulting in a system failure.\nIt both logistically and combinatorically infeasible for every developer to test every change with every combination of components (and component versions) from every other developer. Interface contracts are our first line of defense against incompatible changes. As long as component evolution continues to honor long-established interface contracts, the system should continue to function despite the continuous independent evolution of its constituent components.\nIn this course will examine a variety of interfaces, interface standards and approaches for managing upwards compatible evolution.\n2.6 Progressive Refinement\nLinux did not start out as the fully-featured, all-platform system that it currently is. It started out as an attempt to complement the Gnu tools with a very humble re-implementation of the most basic UNIX kernel functionality. All of the wonderful features we enjoy today were added incrementally. Software projects that attempt to to grand things, starting from a clean slate, often fail after spending many years without delivering useful results.\n\nIt is very difficult to estimate the work in a large project.\nIt is very difficult to anticipate the problems in a large project.\nIt is very difficult to get the requirements right in a large project.\nThey often take so long that they are obsolete before they are finished.\nThey often lose support before they are finished.\n\nReligious wars abound in Software Engineering, but most modern methodologies now seem to embrace some form of iterative or incremental development:\n\nAdd new functionality in smaller, one feature at a time, projects. It is much easier to identify likely problems (and solutions) in a smaller project, and hence to estimate the required work and likely delivery date. Also the work can be done by a smaller team with better communication, and so is likely to be done more efficiently.\nRather than pursue large speculative (if you build it they will come) projects, identify specific users with specific needs, and build something that addresses those needs (while moving us in the right direction). Having a specific problem to solve leads to better requirements. Delivering needed functionality to actual users yields creates more value more quickly.\nDeliver new functionality as quickly as possible to get feedback before moving on to the next step. Most software requirements are speculative. The best way to clarify them is to deliver something and get feedback.\nIt is much easier to plan the next step after we have data from the previous step. Real performance data or user feedback will guide us towards the most important improvements. If we are going down the wrong path, it is best that we find that out as soon as possible.\n\n3. Architectural Paradigms\nOver many decades of building ever more powerful operating systems we have found a few very powerful concepts of very broad applicability.\n3.1 Mechanism/Policy Separation\nThe basic concept is that the mechanisms for managing resources should not dictate or greatly constrain the policies according to which those resources are used. The primary motivation for this principle is that a system is likely to be used used for a long time, in many places, environments and ways that the designers never anticipated. A single resource management strategy that made sense to the designer might prove totally inappropriate for future users. As such resource managers should be designed in two logical parts:\n\nThe mechanisms that keep track of resources and give/revoke client access to them.\nA configurable or plug-in policy engine that controls which clients get which resources when.\n\nA good example of mechanism/policy separation can be seen in card-key lock systems:\n\neach door has a card-key reader and a computer-controlled lock.\neach user is issued a personal card-key.\nto get access to a room, a user swipes a card-key past the reader.\na controlling computer will lookup the registered owner of the card-key in an access control database in order to decide whether or not that user should be granted access to that door at that time, and (if appropriate) send an unlock signal to the associated lock.\n\nThe physical mechanisms are the card-keys, readers, locks, and controlling computer. The resource allocation policy is represented by rules in the access control data-base, which can be configured to support a wide range of access policies. The mechanisms impose very few constraints (beyond those of the rule language) on who should be allowed to enter which rooms when.\nAnd, because the policy is independent from the mechanisms, we could also move to a very different mechanism implementation (e.g. RFID tags), and continue to support the exact same access policies. It should be possible to change either mechanism or policy without greatly impacting the other.\nMechanism/policy separation as a design principle that guides us to build systems that will be usable in a wide range of future contexts. In this course we will look at a few examples of services whose designs exhibit this quality.\n3.2 Indirection, Federation, and Deferred Binding\nPowerful unifying abstractions often give rise to general object classes with multiple implementations. Consider a file system: a collection of files that can be opened, read and written. There can be many different types of file systems (e.g. DOS/FAT file systems on SD cards, ISO 9660 file systems on CD ROMs, Windows NTFS disks, Linux EXT3 disks, etc), but they all implement similar functionality. One could write an operating system that understood all possible file system formats, but the number and range file system formats and rate of evolution dooms that approach to failure. Realistically, we need a way to add support for new file systems independently from the operating system to which they will be connected.\nMany services (e.g. device drivers, video codecs, browser plug-ins) have similar needs. The most common way to accommodate multiple implementations of similar functionality is with plug-in modules that can be added to the system as needed. Such implementations typically share a few features:\n\nA common abstraction (class interface) to which all plug-in modules adhere.\nThe implementations are not built-in to the operating system, but accessed indirectly (e.g. through a pointer to an specific object instance).\nThe indirection is often achieved through some sort of federation framework that registers available implementations and enables clients to select the desired implementation, and automatically routes all future requests to the selected object/implementation.\nThe binding of a client to a particular implementation does not happen when the software is built but rather is deferred until the client actually needs to access a particular resource.\nThe deferred binding may go beyond the client's ability to select an implementation at run-time. The implementing module may be dynamically discovered, and dynamically loaded. It need not be known to or loaded into the operating system until a client requests it.\n\n3.3 Dynamic Equilibrium\nIt is relatively easy to design and tune a system for a particular load. But most systems will be used in a wide range of different conditions, and their loads (both intensity and mix of activities) change over time. This means that there is probably not a single, one-size-fits all configuration for a complex system. This is widely recognized, and most complex systems have numerous tunable parameters that can be used to optimize behavior for a given load. Unfortunately, a good set of tunable parameters is not enough to ensure that systems are well tuned:\n\nTuning parameters tend to be highly tied to a particular implementation, and proper configuration often requires deep understanding of complex processes.\n\nLoads in large systems are subject to continuous change, and parameters that were right five seconds ago may be wrong five seconds from now. It is neither practical nor economical to expect human beings to continuously adjust system configuration in response to changing behavior.\n\nIt is possible to build automated management agents that continuously monitor system behavior, and promptly adjust configuration accordingly. But such automatons can misinterpret symptoms or drive the system into uncontrolled oscillation.\n\nNature is full of very complex systems, very few of which are perfectly tuned. Stability of a complex natural system is often the result of a dynamic equilibrium, where the state of the system is the net result of multiple opposing forces, and any external event that perturbs the equilibrium automatically triggers a reaction in the opposite direction:\n\nThe amount of water in a sealed pot is the net result of evaporation and condensation. When the temperature is raised, more evaporation takes place, which leads to an increase in the steam vapor pressure, which leads to an increased rate of re-condensation.\nThe deer population may be the net result of food supply and predation by wolves. If the food supply increases, an increase in the deer population will lead to an increase in the wolf population, which will reduce the deer population.\n\nIf our resource allocations can be driven by opposing forces, we may be able to design systems that continuously and automatically adapt to a wide range of conditions. In this course we will examine multiple uses of dynamic equilibrium to achieve stable operation in the face of ever-changing loads.\n3.4 The Criticality of Data Structures\nGiven the amount of code we write, it is natural for programmers to focus much attention on algorithms and their implementation. But the solution to many hard software design problems is found, not so much in algorithms, as in data organization. Most of our program state is stored in data structures, and it is often the case that most of our instruction cycles are spent searching, copying and updating data structures. Consequently, our data structure designs (and their correctness/coherency requirements) determine:\n\nwhich operations are fast and which are slow (e.g. because of the number of pointers to be followed)\nwhich operations are simple and which are complex (e.g. because of how many different data structures have to be updated)\nthe locking requirements for each operation (and hence the achievable parallelism)\nthe speed (and success probability) of error recovery (because of the number of possible errors and their detectability/repairability)\n\nOften, when confronted with a difficult performance, robustness, or correctness problem, the solution is found in the right data structures. And given those data structures (and their correctness/coherency assertions) the algorithms often become obvious. In this course we will examine the data structures that underlie much complex functionality, and see how the right data structures have contributed to system performance and robustness.\n4. Life Principles\nLife is made up of huge projects involving a myriad of complex, parallel activities among numerous independent agents (e.g. growing up, getting and education, getting married, finding and keeping a job, raising children, ...). Thus it should not be surprising if many of the lessons we learn from operating systems turn out to be applicable to many other aspects of our lives (and vice versa).\n4.1 There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch\nThere are no Magic Ponies or perpetual motion machines. Everything comes at a cost. There are common situations with simple and obvious solutions, but those solutions don't correctly handle all situations. We often have multiple conflicting goals, and an approach that optimizes one goal usually compromises another. There is almost always a downside.\nAny solution we formulate is likely to involve costs, trade-offs and compromises. Before we can safely change an important system (e.g. an operating system), we must be able to predict (though research, analysis, or prototyping) the likely consequences. The we estimate their impacts, prioritize our goals, and try to optimize our net expected utility.\n4.2 The Devil is Usually in the Details\nEvery once in a while we find a great solution: some beautiful set of paradigms and principles that eliminate nasty problems and greatly simplify the system. But our first articulation of that vision is seldom right, and it must be refined as we try to understand how we will apply it in all of the required situations:\n\nEnumerating (or even identifying) all of the interesting cases is a great deal of work.\nIn many cases, it may not be obvious how to make a particular situation fit in to our beautiful high level structure.\nSometimes we encounter one nasty case that simply refuses to fit into the new model.\nSometimes we can extend our model to embrace the troublesome cases.\nSometimes we can sub-case, preclude or exclude the troublesome cases.\nSometimes we conclude that, while beautiful, our idea doesn't work.\n\nHaving an inspiration is fun, exciting, and rewarding. But it isn't real until you have worked out all of the details. (Ask any String Theorist.)\n4.3 Keep It Simple, Stupid and If it ain't broke, don't fix it\nEinstein was once quoted as saying:\nEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\nAs should be clear from this paper, complexity is the enemy. The problems we face are complex enough, but sometimes we voluntarily add gratuitous complexity to our solutions. It is natural to look at a solution and recognize enhancements that would make it smarter, or more complete, or more elegant. These insights are fun, but they often prove to be counter-productive:\n\nMany optimizations require extra work to better handle special cases, and that extra work may greatly reduce the benefits of the optimization.\nMany ideas that seem simple at first become more complex as we examine all of the cases that have to be correctly handled.\nMore complex solutions are likely to have more complex behavior, including unanticipated consequences. If we cannot predict the behavior associated with changes, we are likely to find that we have created new problems.\nMore complex solutions are more difficult to understand, and hence more likely to have undetected errors and more difficult to maintain.\n\nThere are surely problems that call for very smart solutions, but it is often the case that a simpler solution works better than a more clever solution. It is best to avoid more complex solutions unless we have hard data that simpler solutions are not viable and that the smarter solution would fix the problem.\n4.4 Be Clear about your Goals\nWe occasionally build software for fun, but usually we do so with a purpose in mind. It has often been said that if we do not clearly understand our goals, it will only be by accident that we achieve them.\nAs we pursue a project we will be confronted by many decisions. Some questions are of the form \"will this work\", and can usually be answered by research, analysis or prototyping. But we will also encounter \"which is better\" questions. Some of these will have objective (e.g. measurable performance) answers, but some will come down to priorities and perspectives. A clear understanding (and prioritization) of our goals can help us with these questions, by allowing us to ask how each of our alternatives would impact each of our goals.\nAs we pursue a project we will see many problems and opportunities. We are in a creative problem solving mode, and it is natural to automatically leap to approaches to address problems and exploit opportunities. But not every opportunity we encounter is on the path to our ultimate goals, and not every problem we encounter is actually blocking the path to our ultimate goals. If we expand the scope of our effort to solving non-critical problems or achieving non-goals, we may find that we have over-constrained our requirements ... making it much more difficult to achieve our goals.\nIt is also important to keep in mind the high level goals, from which our detailed goals may have been derived. Our detailed goals might be to speed up some operation and eliminate a confusing parameter from some interface. But the real goal was to make the system faster and easier to use. If we myopically focus only on our micro-goals, without periodically assessing ourselves against the higher level goals, we may find that we have won all the battles, but lost the war.\nHaving a clear understanding of our goals will enable us to resolve differences of opinion, make better decisions, and avoid distractions.\n4.5 Responsibility and Sustainability\nWe are going to live for a relatively long time, and when we are gone, our children will live in the world we left them. We need to understand the long-view consequences of our actions, how they will eventually effect us and others, and then act responsibly for the best long-run outcome.\nThe same principles apply to operating systems. No software-managed resource can ever be lost. All memory and secondary storage will be recycled over and over again. Errors cannot be dismissed as unlikely events, and no error can be left un-handled. Every reasonably anticipatable problem must be correctly detected and handled, so that the system can continue executing. It is commonly observed that the main differences between professional and amateur software are completeness and error handling. We are all responsible for anticipating and dealing with all the consequences of our actions. OS designers are not, by nature, optimists.\n5. Conclusions\nDespite the fact that Operating Systems encompass ever more responsibility, relatively few people will actually build operating systems software. But most of us will work on complex software, and we will encounter problems that have already been encountered, understood, and solved by computer scientists, architects, and developers in the field of Operating Systems.\nAs you read about various mechanisms and issues within operating systems, study them with these principles in mind. As we analyze implications and contrast alternatives, try to pull these principles into the discussion and see if they shed light on the problems. Understand these principles, learn to recognize these problems when you encounter them, and how to apply these solutions to new problems.\nPowerful tools these are. Serve you they will.\n"},"readings/lec1/intro.html":{"url":"readings/lec1/intro.html","title":"Introduction to Operating Systems","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to Operating Systems\nIntroduction to Operating Systems\n\nKeywords: Computer program execution, Von Neumann model.\nDetails: The document starts with the basics of how a computer program executes instructions millions of times per second, setting the stage for discussing the complex functionalities an OS performs to make the system easy to use.\n\nThe Crux of the Problem: How to Virtualize Resources\n\nKeywords: Virtualization, resources, mechanisms, policies, hardware support.\nDetails: Central to the document is the exploration of how the OS virtualizes physical resources like the processor, memory, or disk into more general, powerful, and easy-to-use virtual forms, highlighting the mechanisms and policies employed to achieve efficient virtualization.\n\nOperating Systems as Virtual Machines\n\nKeywords: Virtualization technique, interfaces (APIs), system calls.\nDetails: It describes the OS as a virtual machine that transforms physical resources into virtual forms, offering a few hundred system calls to applications for interacting with these resources.\n\nResource Management\n\nKeywords: CPU, memory, disk, resource manager.\nDetails: The OS's role as a resource manager is outlined, managing the CPU, memory, and disk as shared resources and distributing them efficiently or fairly among processes.\n\nPractical Examples\n\nKeywords: Process execution, memory access, concurrency, persistence.\nDetails: Through practical code examples, the document illustrates how the OS manages process execution, memory access, and the challenges of concurrency.

Actually,\n\nWhitney's parts weren't all that interchangeable,\nhe got the idea from a French gunsmith (Honore Blanc),\nthe Swedish clock maker Christopher Polhem did a much better job with clock gears 50 years earlier.\n\nBut, be that as it may, interchangeable parts revolutionized, and in fact enabled modern manufacturing. The underlying concept is that there be specifications for every part. If each part is manufactured and measured to be within its specifications, then any collection of these parts can be assembled into a working whole. This greatly reduces the cost and difficulty of building a working system out of component parts.\nThe same principle applies to software. If you want to open a file on a Posix system, you use the open system call. There may be a hundred different implementations of open but this doesn't matter because they all conform to the same interface specification. The rewards for this standardization are:\n\nYour work as a programmer is simplified, because you don't have to write your own file I/O routines.\nYour program is likely to be easily portable to any Posix compliant system, because they all provide the same file I/O services.\nTraining time for new programmers is reduced, because everybody already knows how to use the Posix file I/O functions.\n\nThe Criticality of Interfaces in Architecture\nA system architecture defines the major components of the system, the functionality of each, and the interfaces between them. Clearly the component interface specifications are a critical element of any architecture. To the extent that these interfaces have been well considered and well defined, it should be possible to (at least semi) independently design and implement those components. In principle, any implementations that satisfy those functional and interface specifications should combine to yield a working system.\nThe converse is also true. To the extent that interfaces between components were poorly considered or specified, it becomes unlikely that independently developed components will work when combined together, and more likely that subsequent changes to one component will break others.\nThe Importance of Interface Stability\nWe write contracts is so that everybody knows what will be expected of them, and what they can expect from the other parties to the agreement. Everybody will depend on you to uphold your obligations under the contract. A software interface specification is a form of contract:\n\nthe contract describes an interface and the associated functionality.\nimplementation providers agree that their systems will conform to the specification.\ndevelopers agree to limit their use of the functionality to what is described in the interface specification.\n\nAnd in return for this they get all the benefits described above.\nSuppose that some architectural genius realized that Posix file semantics are too weak to describe the behavior of files in a distributed system, and that this could be solved by adding a new (required) parameter (for a call-back routine) to the Posix open call. What would happen?\n\nsoftware written to the new semantics would have access to richer behavior, and would function better in cases of node and network failures.\nsoftware written to the new semantics would not work on other Posix compliant systems.\nsoftware written to the old semantics would not work on the new systems.\ncustomers (knowing nothing about this techno-feud) would be faced with inexplicable failures, and would start complaining to their software and system providers (none of whom were responsible for the change).\nprogrammers would be confused about which version of open they were using, and would probably get around the problem by writing their own file I/O packages ... a bunch of extra work, but at least it would protect them from future such acts of mischief.\n\nAnd as a result of this, we would lose all of the benefits described above. When you promise somebody that you will do something (e.g. conform to a specified interface), and they depend on you (e.g. by writing code to that interface), and you don't follow through (e.g. make an incompatible change) ... problems are likely to ensue (e.g. failures, bug reports, product gets a bad reputation, going out of business, etc.).\nInterfaces vs. Implementations\nSuppose that someone writes a handy library to efficiently provide reliable communication over an unreliable network, and I decide I want to use it. I download their development kit and start using it, and find it to be great. A few weeks into the project I realize that I need a feature that is not included in their documentation, but after reading their code I discover that the needed feature is actually available. I use it and my product is a great success.\nSix months later, they release a new version of their reliable communications library, and my product immediately breaks. After a little debugging I discover that they have changed the undocumented code that I was depending on. It turns out that I had not designed my product to work with their interfaces. My product only worked with a particular implementation ... and implementations change.\nPeople often put much more work into designing and maintaining their code than to clarifying and maintaining their documentation. This makes it tempting to reverse engineer the interface specifications from a provided implementation. But an interface should exist (and be defined) independently from any particular implementation. Confusing an implementation with an interface usually ends badly!\nProgram vs. User Interfaces\nHuman beings are amazingly robust. We could change the text in dialog boxes, rearrange input forms, add new required input items, and rework all of the menus in a program, and many users would figure out the changes in a few seconds. This inclines many developers to be cavalier in making changes to user interfaces.\nCode is nowhere nearly so robust. If I expect my second parameter to be a file name, and you pass me the address of a call-back routine instead, the best we can hope for is a good error message and a quick coredump with no data corruption.\nIf all users were developers, and only ran their own code, this might be just an irritation. We would get the core dump, track it down, figure out that some idiot had made this change, recode accordingly, and an hour later we'd be good as new. Unfortunately most people run code that they do not understand, and have no way to debug or fix. If a program breaks, all I can do is call support and complain. I am helpless. Users don't care which programmer goofed up. \"I bought your product. It doesn't work. I'm taking my business elsewhere!\".\nIf you are going to be delivering binary software to non-developers (that describes 99.999% of all software) you have to trust that what ever platform they run it on will correctly implement all of the interfaces on which your program depends.\nThe same argument applies, though not quite as strongly, to independent components in a single system. If components exchange services, and I make an incompatible change to the interfaces of one component, this has the potential to break other components in the same system. I can fix the other components in our system to work with the new changes but:\n\nthis complicates the making of the change.\nwe have to ensure that mismatched component sets are impossible.\n\nIs every interface carved in stone?\nAbsolutely not.\nYou are free to add features that do not change the interface specification (a faster or more robust implementation). In many cases you can add upwards-compatible extensions (all old programs will still work the same way, but new interfaces enable new software to access new functionality). There are a few ways to add incompatible changes to old interfaces without breaking backwards compatibility:\n\nInterface Polymorphism\nIn old-school languages (like FORTRAN and C) a routine had a single interface specification. But more contemporary programming languages support polymorphism (different method signatures with different parameter and return types). If different versions of a method are readily distinguishable (e.g. by the number and types of their parameters), it may be possible to provide new interfaces to meet new requirements, while continuing to support the older interfaces for backwards compatibility with older applications.\nVersioned Interfaces\nBackwards compatibility requirements do not prevent us from changing interfaces; they merely require us to continue providing old interfaces to old clients. In many cases, it may be possible for an application to call out which version of an interface it requires:\n\nJava programs are labeled with the run-time-environment versions they require.\nNetwork protocol (e.g. RPC) sessions often begin with a version negotiation, where each side states the interface versions that it can support, so that a mutually acceptable version can be chosen.\n\nThis approach does permit incompatible interface changes, but still requires servers to support old as well as new interface versions.\n\n\nBut even if we have no ability to deliver multiple interface versions, this does not necessarily mean I can never make incompatible changes. It is not the case that all interfaces must be supported for all of time. It is merely necessary that the interface stability be understood, and adequate to achieve the product (or project) goals:\n\nIt is common to provide alpha/evaluation access to proposed new services/interfaces. This is done with the understanding that the final interfaces are likely to be different. Such releases are provided purely for evaluation purposes. Understanding the likelihood of change, developers should only use them for prototyping, and should not base long-lived products on them.\n\nMany suppliers have interface stability guidelines for their releases. A typical example might be:\n\na micro-release (e.g. 3.4.1) includes only bug fixes.\na minor-release (e.g. 3.5) includes new functions, but us upwards compatible with the underlying major release version.\na major release (e.g. 4.0) is allowed to make incompatible changes to previously committed interfaces.\n\nApplications software developers can use this to determine which versions their software will run on, and customers can use this to decide whether or not they can safely upgrade to a new release.\n\nMany suppliers have make specific support commitments (e.g. we will support release 3.5 for five years from its initial availability date). This gives software developers and customers confidence that they will have a stable software platform for at least that long. At the end of that period, customers may have to choose between continuing to run on a no-longer-supported platform or moving to new versions of their mission-critical applications.\n\n\nHow stable an interface needs to be depends on how you intend to use it. What is important is that:\n\nwe be honest about our intentions and set realistic expectations.\nwe have a plan for how we will manage change.\n\nInterface Stability and Design\nSo, if we want to expose an interface to unbundled software with high quality requirements, we are not allowed to change it in non-upwards-compatible ways. That sounds like a bother, but if that is the rules, so be it. What has this got to do with architecture and design?\nWhen we design a system, and the interfaces between the independent components, we need to consider all of the different types of change that are likely to happen over the life of this system. When we specify our external component interfaces we need to have high confidence that will be able to accommodate all of the envisioned evolution while preserving those interfaces.\n\nWe might rearrange the distribution of functionality between components to create a simpler (and hence more preservable) interface between them.\nWe might design features that we may never implement, just to make sure that the specified interfaces will accommodate them if we ever do decide to build them.\nWe might introduce (seemingly) unnatural degrees of abstraction in our services to ensure that they leave us enough slack for future changes.\n\nWe must consider which of our interfaces will need to be how stable, and design our system with those stabilities in mind.\n"},"readings/lec3/Software_Interfaces.html":{"url":"readings/lec3/Software_Interfaces.html","title":"Software Interfaces","keywords":"","body":"Software Interfaces\nSoftware Interface Standards\nIntroduction\nOver two thousand years ago, Carthage defined standard component sizes for their naval vessels, so that parts from one ship could be used to repair another. Slightly more recently, George Washington gave Eli Whitney a contract to build 12,000 muskets with interchangeable parts. The standardization of component interfaces makes it possible to successfully combine or recombine components made at different times by different people.\nIn the last half-century we have seen tremendous advances in both electronics and software, many of which are attributable to the availability of powerful, off-the-shelf components (integrated circuits, and software packages) that can be used to design and develop new products. We no longer have to reinvent the wheel for each new project, freeing us to focus our time and energy on the novel elements of each new design. As with ship and musket parts, the keys to this are interchangeability and interoperability: confidence that independently manufactured components will fit and work together. This confidence comes from the availability of and compliance with detailed component specifications.\nIn the early days of the computer industry, much key software (operating systems, compilers) was developed by hardware manufacturers, for whom compatibility was an anti-goal. If a customer's applications could only run on their platform, it would be very expensive/difficult for that customer to move to a competing platform. Later, with the rise of Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and killer applications, the situation was reversed:\n\nThe cost of building different versions of an application for different hardware platforms was very high, so the ISVs wanted to do as few ports as possible.\nComputer sales were driven by the applications they could support. If the ISVs did not port their applications to your platform, you would quickly lose all of your customers.\nSoftware Portability became a matter of life and death for both the hardware manufacturers and the software vendors.\n\nIf applications are to be readily ported to all platforms, all platforms must support the same services. This means that we need detailed specifications for all services, and comprehensive compliance testing to ensure the correctness and compatibility of those implementations.\nThe other big change was in who the customers for computers and software were. In the 1960s, most computers were used in business and technology, and the people who used computers were professional programmers: trained and prepared to deal with the adverse side effects of new software releases. Today, most computers are in tablets, phones, cars, televisions, and appliances; and the people who use them are ordinary consumers who expect them to just work. These changes imply that:\n\nNew applications have to work on both old and new devices.\nSoftware upgrades (e.g. to the underlying operating system) cannot break existing applications.\n\nBut the number of available applications, and the independent development and delivery of OS upgrades and new applications make it impossible to test every application with every OS version (or vice versa). If the combinatorics of the problem render complete testing impossible, we have to find another way to ensure that whatever combination of software components wind up on a particular device will work together. And again, the answer is detailed specifications and comprehensive compliance testing.\nThe last forty years have seen a tremendous growth in software standards organization participation (both by technology providers and consumers) and the the scope, number, and quality of standards.\nChallenges of Software Interface Standardization\nWhen a technology or service achieves wide penetration, it becomes important to establish standards. Television would never have happened if each broadcaster and manufacturer had chosen different formats for TV signals. In the short term, a slightly better implementation (e.g. cleaner picture) may give some providers an advantage in the market place. But ultimately the fragmentation of the marketplace ill-serves both producers and consumers.\nIf the stake-holders get together and agree on a single standard format for TV broadcasts, every TV set can receive every station. Consumers are freed to choose any TV set they want to watch any stations they want. Since all TV sets receive the same signals, set manufacturers must compete on the basis of price, quality, and other features. The cost of TV sets goes down and their quality goes up. Since all stations can reach all viewers, they must compete on the basis of programming. The amount, quality, and variety of programming increases. And the growing market creates opportunities for new products and services that were previously unimaginable.\nStandards are a good thing:\n\nThe details are debated by many experts over long periods of time. The extensive review means they will probably be well considered, and broad enough to encompass a wide range of applications.\nBecause the contributors work for many different organizations, with different strengths, it is likely that the standards will be relatively platform-neutral, not greatly favoring or disadvantaging any particular providers.\nBecause they must serve as a basis for compatible implementations, they tend to have very clear and complete specifications and well developed conformance testing procedures.\nThey give technology suppliers considerable freedom to explore alternative implementations (to improve reliability, performance, portability, maintainability), as long as they maintain the specified external behavior. Any implementation that conforms to the standard should work with all existing and future clients.\n\nBut standardization is the opposite of diversity and evolution, and so is a two-edged sword:\n\nAt the same time, they greatly constrain the range of possible implementations. An interface will specify who provides what information, in what form, at what time. It might be possible to provide a much better implementation of that functionality, if slightly different information could be provided at a different time. But if the new interfaces are not 100% upwards compatible with the old ones, the improved design would be non-compliant. Television was pioneered in the United States, but because we were among the first to standardize (e.g. before color was imagined to be possible), a few decades later we found ourselves locked into having the worst (most primitive) TV signals on earth.\nInterface standards also impose constraints on their consumers. An application that has been written to a well-supported standard can have high confidence of working on any compliant platform. But this warrantee is voided if the application uses any feature in any way that is not explicitly authorized by the standard. An application that uses non-standard features (or standard features in non-standard ways) is likely to encounter problems on new platforms or with new releases of the software providing those features. For many years, Windows users refused to upgrade to new releases because of the near certainty that a few of their devices and applications would stop working.\nWhen many different stake-holders depend on a standard, it often becomes difficult to evolve those standards to meet changing requirements:\nThere will be many competing opinions about exactly what the new requirements should be and how to best address them.\nIt seems that any change (no matter how beneficial) will adversely affect some stake-holders, and they will object to the improvements.\n\n\n\nThese trade-offs are fundamental to all standards. But there are additional considerations that make software interface standards particularly difficult.\nConfusing interfaces with Implementations\nEngineers are inclined to think in terms of design: how we will solve a particular problem? But interface standards should not specify design. Rather they should specify behavior, in as implementation-neutral a way as possible. But true implementation neutrality is very difficult, because existing implementations often provide the context against which we frame our problem statements. It is common to find that a standard developed ten years ago cannot reasonably be extended to embrace a new technology because it was written around a particular set of implementations.\nThe other way this problem comes about is when the interface specifications are written after the fact (or worse by reverse engineering):\n\nSince the implementation was not developed to or tested against the interface specification, it may not actually comply with it.\nIn the absence of specifications, it may be difficult to determine whether particular behavior is a fundamental part of the interface or a peculiarity of the current implementation.\n\nA common piece of Management 1A wisdom is:\nThis is particularly true of interface specifications.\nThe rate of evolution, for both technology and applications\nThe technologies that go into computers are evolving quickly (e.g. Wifi, Bluetooth, USB, power-management, small screen mobile devices), and our software must evolve to exploit them. The types of applications we develop are also evolving dramatically (e.g. from desk-top publishing to social networking). Nobody would expect to be able to pull the engine out of an old truck and drop-in replace it with a new hybrid electric motor. Yet everybody expects to be able to run the latest apps on their ancient phone, laptop or desktop for as long as it keeps running.\nMaintaining stable interfaces in the face of fast and dramatic evolution is extremely difficult. Microsoft Windows was designed as a single-user Personal Computer operating system - making it very difficult to extend its OS service APIs to embrace the networked applications and large servers that dominate today's world. When faced with such change we find ourselves forced to choose between:\n\nMaintaining strict compatibility with old interfaces, and not supporting new applications and/or platforms. This is (ultimately) the path to obsolescence.\nDeveloping new interfaces that embrace new technologies and uses, but are incompatible with older interfaces and applications. This choice sacrifices existing customers for the chance to win new ones.\nA compromise that partially supports new technologies and applications, while remaining mostly compatible with old interfaces. This is the path most commonly taken, but it often proves to be both uncompetitive and incompatible.\n\nThere is a fundamental conflict between stable interfaces and embracing change.\nProprietary vs Open Standards\nA Proprietary interface is one that is developed and controlled by a single organization (e.g. the Microsoft Windows APIs). An Open Standard is one that is developed and controlled by a consortium of providers and/or consumers (e.g. the IETF network protocols). Whenever a technology provider develops a new technology they must make a decision:\n\nShould they open their interface definitions to competitors, to achieve a better standard, more likely to be widely adopted? This costs of this decision are:\nReduced freedom to adjust interfaces to respond to conflicting requirements.\nGiving up the competitive advantage that might come from being the first/only provider.\nBeing forced to re-engineer existing implementations to bring them into compliance with committee-adopted interfaces.\n\n\nShould they keep their interfaces proprietary, perhaps under patent protection, to maximize their competitive advantage? The costs of this decision are:\nIf a competing, open standard evolves, and ours is not clearly superior, it will eventually lose and our market position will suffer as a result.\nCompeting standards fragment the market and reduce adoption.\nWith no partners, we will have to shoulder the full costs of development and evangelization. In an open standards consortium, these costs would be distributed over many more participants.\n\n\n\nThis dilemma often complicates the development of interface standards. The participants may not only be trying to develop strong standards; Many are also trying to gain market position and protect prior investments.\nApplication Programming Interfaces\nMost of the time, when we look up and exploit some service, we are working with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). A typical API specification is open(2), which includes:\n\nA list of included routines/methods, and their signatures (parameters, return types)\nA list of associated macros, data types, and data structures\nA discussion of the semantics of each operation, and how it should be used\nA discussion of all of the options, what each does, and how it should be used\nA discussion of return values and possible errors\n\nThe specifications may also include or refer to sample usage scenarios.\nThe most important thing to understand about API specifications is that they are written at the source programming level (e.g. C, C++ , Java, Python). They describe how source code should be written in order to exploit these features. API specifications are a basis for software portability, but applications must be recompiled for each platform:\n\nThe benefit for applications developers is that an application written to a particular API should easily recompile and correctly execute on any platform that supports that API.\nThe benefit for platform suppliers is that any application written to supported APIs should easily port to their platform.\n\nBut this promise can only be delivered if the API has been defined in a platform-independent way:\n\nAn API that defined some type as int (implicitly assuming that to be at least 64 bits wide) might not work on a 32 bit machine.\nAn API that accessed individual bytes within an int might not work on a big-endian machine.\nAn API that assumed a particular feature implementation (e.g. fork(2)) might not be implementable on some platforms (e.g. Windows).\n\nOne of the many advantages of an Open Standard is that diverse participants will find and correct these problems.\nApplication Binary Interfaces\nWell defined and widely supported Application Programming Interfaces are very good things, but they are not enough. If you are reading this, you are probably fully capable of re-compiling an application for a new platform, given access to the sources. But most users do not have access to the sources for most of the software they use, and probably couldn't successfully compile it if they did. Most people just want to download a program and run it.\nBut (if we ignore interpreted languages like Java and Python) executable programs are compiled (and linkage edited) for a particular instruction set architecture and operating system. How is it possible to build a binary application that will (with high confidence) run on any Android phone, or any x86 Linux? This problem is not addressed by (source level) Application Programming Interfaces. This problem is addressed by Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs):\nAn Application Binary Interface is the binding of an Application Programming Interface to an Instruction Set Architecture.\nAn API defines subroutines, what they do, and how to use them. An ABI describes the machine language instructions and conventions that are used (on a particular platform) to call routines. A typical ABI contains things like:\n\nThe binary representation of key data types\nThe instructions to call to and return from a subroutine\nStack-frame structure and respective responsibilities of the caller and callee\nHow parameters are passed and return values are exchanged\nRegister conventions (which are used for what, which must be saved and restored)\nThe analogous conventions for system calls, and signal deliveries\nThe formats of load modules, shared objects, and dynamically loaded libraries\n\nThe portability benefits of an ABI are much greater than those for an API. If an application is written to a supported API, and compiled and linkage edited by ABI-compliant tools, the resulting binary load module should correctly run, unmodified, on any platform that supports that ABI. A program compiled for the x86 architecture on an Intel P6 running Ubuntu can reasonably be expected to execute correctly on an AMD processor running FreeBSD or (on a good day) even Windows. As long as the CPU and Operating System support that ABI, there should be no need to recompile a program to be able to run it on a different CPU, Operating System, distribution, or release. This much stronger portability to a much wider range of platforms makes it practical to build and distribute binary versions of applications to large and diverse markets (like PC or Android users).\nWho actually uses the Application Binary Interfaces\nMost programmers will never directly deal with an ABI, as it is primarily used by:\n\nthe compiler, to generate code for procedure entry, exit, and calls\nthe linkage editor, to create load modules\nthe program loader, to read load modules into memory\nthe operating system (and low level libraries) to process system calls\n\nBut it is occasionally used by programmers who need to write assembly language subroutines (for efficiency or privileged operations) that can be called from a higher level language (e.g. C or C++).\n"},"readings/lec4/":{"url":"readings/lec4/","title":"Lecture 4: CPU and Virtualization","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 4: CPU and Virtualization\n"},"readings/lec4/Linking_and_libraries.html":{"url":"readings/lec4/Linking_and_libraries.html","title":"Linking and Libraries","keywords":"","body":"Linking and Libraries\nObject Modules, Linkage Editing, Libraries\nIntroduction\nOne of the most fundamental abstract resources implemented by an operating system is the process. A process is often defined as an executing instance of a program. If we want to understand what a process is, it is very helpful to understand what a program is. We most often think of a program as one or more files (e.g. C, Java, Python). C sources are not executable programs, but rather source files that can be translated into machine language and combined with other machine language modules to create executable programs.\nFrom the operating system’s perspective, a program is a file full of ones and zeros, that when loaded into memory, become machine-language instructions that can be executed by the computer on which we are running.\n\nHow do our source modules come to be translated into machine language instructions?\nHow do they come to be combined with other machine language modules to form complete programs?\nWhat is the format of a file that contains an executable program, and how does it come to be correctly loaded into memory?\n\nThese are a few of the questions we will discuss in this chapter.\nThe Software Generation Tool Chain\nIf we limit our discussion to compiled (vs interpreted) languages, we can typically divide the files that represent programs into a few general classes:\n\nsource modules\neditable text in some language (e.g. C, assembler, Java) that can be translated into machine language by a compiler or assembler.\nrelocatable object modules\nsets of compiled or assembled instructions created from individual source modules, but which are not yet complete programs.\nlibraries\ncollections of object modules, from which we can fetch functions that are required by (and not contained in) the original source/object modules.\nload modules\ncomplete programs (usually created by combining numerous object modules) that are ready to be loaded into memory (by the operating system) and executed (by the CPU).\n\n\n\nFig 1. Components of the Software Generation Tool Chain\nThis figure shows a typical software generation tool chain, with the rounded boxes representing software tools that are run and the rectangles with one corner cut off representing files used (and sometimes created) during the process. The large rectangle in the lower left is the final result, a process that the operating system can schedule and run.\nLet’s consider the components of this software tool chain in the order they are used.\n\nCompiler\nReads source modules and included header files, parses the input language (e.g. C or Java), and infers the intended computations, for which it will generate lower level code. More often than not, that code will be produced in assembly language code rather than machine language. This provides greater flexibility for further processing (e.g. optimization), may make the compiler more portable, and simplifies the compiler by pushing some of the work out to a subsequent phase. There are, however, languages (e.g. Java, Python) whose compilers directly produce a pseudo-machine language that will be executed by a virtual machine or interpreter.\nAssembler\nAssembly language is much lower level, with each line of code often translating directly to a single machine language instruction or data item. But the assembly language still allows the declaration of variables, the use of macros, and references to externally defined code and data. Developers occasionally write routines directly in assembly language (e.g. when they need specific code that the compiler is incapable of generating).\nIn user-mode code, modules written in assembler often include:\n\nperformance critical string and data structure manipulations\nroutines to implement calls into the operating system\n\nIn the operating system, modules written in assembler often include:\n\nCPU initialization\nfirst level trap/interrupt handlers\nsynchronization operations\n\nThe output of the assembler is an object module containing mostly machine language code. But, because the output corresponds only to a single input module for the linkage editor:\n\nsome functions (or data items) may not yet be present, and so their addresses will not yet be filled in.\neven locally defined symbols may not have yet been assigned hard in-memory addresses, and so may be expressed as offsets relative to some TBD starting point.\n\n\n\n  Linkage editor\n  The linkage editor reads a specified set of object modules, placing them consecutively into a virtual address space, and noting where (in that virtual address space) each was placed. It also notes unresolved external references (to symbols referenced by, but not defined by the loaded object modules). It then searches a specified set of libraries to find object modules that can satisfy those references, and places them in the evolving virtual address space as well. After locating and placing all of the required (specified and implied) object modules, it finds every reference to a relocatable or external symbol and updates it to reflect the address where the desired code/data was actually placed.\n  The resulting bits represent a program that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed, and they are written out into a new file, called an executable load module.\n  Program loader\n  The program loader is usually part of the operating system. It examines the information in a load module, creates an appropriate virtual address space, and reads the instructions and initialized data values from the load module into that virtual address space. If the load module includes references to additional (shared) libraries, the program loader finds them and maps them into appropriate places in the virtual address space as well.\nOnce the virtual address space has been created and the required code has been copied into (virtual) memory, the program can be executed by the CPU.\nObject Modules\nA program must be complete before it is ready to be loaded into memory and be executed; all of the code to be executed must be included in the program. But when we write software, we do not put all of the code that will be executed into a single file:\n\nA single file containing everything would be huge, difficult to understand, and cumbersome to update. Code is more understandable and maintainable if it different types of functionality are broken out into (relatively) independent modules.\nMany functions (e.g. string manipulation, formatted output, mathematical functions, image decoding) are commonly used. Making these modules available for reuse (from externally supplied libraries) greatly reduces the work associated with writing new programs.\n\nMost programs are created by combining multiple modules together. These program fragments are called relocatable object modules, and differ from executable (load) modules in at least two interesting respects:\n\nThey may be incomplete, in that they make references to code or data items that must be supplied from other modules.\nBecause they have not yet been combined together into a program, it has not yet been determined where (at which addresses) they will be loaded into memory, and so even references to code or data items within the same module can have only relative (to the start of the module) addresses.\n\nObviously the code (machine language instructions) within an object module are Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specific; The pattern of ones and zeroes that represents an add instruction for an Intel Pentium is quite different than those that represent the same operation on an ARM or PowerPC. But it might surprise you to learn that many contemporary object module formats are common across many Instruction Set Architectures. One very popular format (for Unix and Linux systems) is called ELF (Executable and Linkable Format). The ELF format is described in elf(5), but an ELF module is divided into multiple consecutive sections:\n\nA header section, that describes the types, sizes, and locations of the other sections.\nCode and Data sections, each containing bytes (of code or data) that are to be loaded (contiguously) into memory.\nA symbol table that lists external symbols defined or needed by this module.\nA collection of relocation entries, each of which describes:\nthe location of a field (in a code or data section) that requires relocation\nthe width/type of the field to be relocated (e.g. 32 or 64 bit address)\nthe symbol table entry, whose address should be used to perform that relocation\n\n\n\n\nFig 2. A Program in Various Stages of Preparation for Execution\nLibraries\nIn addition to its own modules, an interesting program could easily use hundreds, or even thousands of standard/reusable functions. Specifying which of thousands of available functions are to be included would be extremely cumbersome. This problem is dealt with by creating libraries of useful functions. A library is simply a collection of (usually related) object modules. One library might contain standard system calls, while another might contain commonly used mathematical functions. Reusable code is often distributed in and obtained from libraries. But not all libraries are public collections of reusable code. If my program were made up of hundreds of modules, I might choose to organize my own code into one or more libraries. Different operating systems (and some languages) may implement libraries in different ways (e.g. Java packages), but the concept of packaging groups of related modules together is common to most software development tool chains.\nThe Linux command for creating, updating, and examining libraries is ar(1).\nBuilding a program usually starts by combining a group of enumerated object modules (that constitute the core of the program to be built). The resulting aggregation will almost surely contain unresolved external references (e.g. calls to routines that are to be supplied from libraries). The next step is to search a list of enumerated libraries to find modules that contain the required functions (can satisfy the unresolved external references).\nLibraries are not always orthogonal and independent:\n\nIt is common to implement higher level libraries (e.g. image file decoding) using functionality from lower level libraries (e.g. mathematical functions and file I/O).\nIt is not uncommon to use alternative implementations for some library functionality (e.g. a diagnostic memory allocator) or to intercept calls to standard functions to collect usage data.\n\nThis means that the order in which libraries are searched may be very important. If we call a function from library A, and library A calls functions from library B, we may need to search library A before searching library B. If we want to override the standard malloc(3) with valgrind’s more powerful diagnostic version, we need to search the valgrind library before we search the standard C library.\nLinkage Editing\nAt least three things need to be done to turn a collection of relocatable object modules into a runnable program:\n\nResolution: search the specified libraries to find object modules that can satisfy all unresolved external references.\nLoading: lay the text and data segments from all of those object modules down in a single virtual address space, and note where (in that virtual address space) each symbol was placed.\nRelocation: go through all of the relocation entries in all of the loaded object modules, each reference to correctly reflect the chosen addresses.\n\nThese operations are called Linkage Editing, because we are filling in all of the linkages (connections) between the loaded modules. The program that does this is called a linkage editor. The command to perform linkage editing in UNIX/Linux systems is ld(1). Going back to our previous object module example, the linkage editor would search the specified libraries for a module that could satisfy the external _foo reference,\n\nFig 3. Finding External References in a Library\nFinding such a module, the linkage editor would add it to the virtual address space it was accumulating:\n\nFig 4. Updating a Process’ Virtual Address Space\nThen, with all unresolved external references satisfied, and all relocatable addresses fixed, the linkage editor would go back and perform all of the relocations called out in the object modules.\n\nFig 5. Performing a Relocation in an Load Module\nAt this point, all relocatable addresses have been adjusted to reflect the locations at which they were loaded, and all unresolved external references have been filled in. The program (load module) is now complete and ready to be executed.\nLoad Modules\nA load module is similar in format to an object module, in that it contains multiple sections (code, data, symbol table); But, unlike an object module, it is (a) complete and (b) requires no relocation. Each section specifies the address (in the process’ virtual address space) at which it should be loaded. When the operating system is instructed to load a new program (with the exec(2) system call), it:\n\nConsults the load module to determine the required text and data segment sizes and locations.\nAllocates the appropriate segments within the virtual address space.\nReads the contents of the text and data segments from the load module into memory.\nCreates a stack segment, and initializes the stack pointer to point to it.\n\nAt this point, the program is ready to execute, and the operating system transfers control to its entry point (which is also specified in the load module).\nYou might wonder, if there is no further relocation to be performed, why a load module might still contain a symbol table? Neither loading nor executing the program requires the symbol table. But if the program were to receive an exception (say at address 0x604C), the symbol table would enable us to determine that the error occurred twelve bytes into the _foo routine. Many load modules do not have any symbol tables (to save space, reduce download time, or make it harder for competitors to disassemble their code). Some load modules contain extensive symbol tables, including entry point addresses, data structure descriptions, source code line numbers, and other information to assist intelligent debuggers.\nStatic vs. Shared Libraries\nIn the above described linkage editing process, library modules were directly (and permanently) incorporated into the load module.\n\nFig 6. Virtual Address Space with Statically Linked Libraries\nBecause of this permanence, this process is referred to as static linking. It has at least two significant disadvantages:\n\nMany libraries (e.g. libc) are used by almost every program on the system. Thousands of identical copies of the same code increase the required down-load time, disk space (to store them), start-up time (to read them into memory) and memory (while they are executing). It would be much more efficient if we could somehow allow all of the programs that used a popular library to share a single copy.\nPopular libraries change over time with enhancements, optimizations, and bug fixes. Some enhancements may be very important (e.g. enabling applications to work with a new version of the operating system). In most cases, a newer version of a library is probably better than an older version. But with static linking, each program is built with a frozen version of each library, as it was at the time the program was linkage edited. It might be better (for software reliability) if it was possible to automatically load the latest library versions each time a program was started.\n\nThese issues are addressed by run-time loadable, shared libraries. There are many possible approaches, but the simplest way to implement shared libraries is to:\n\nReserve an address for each shared library. This is possible in 32-bit architectures, and easy in 64-bit architectures.\nLinkage edit each shared library into a read-only code segment, loaded at the address reserved for that library.\nAssign a number (0-n) to each routine, and put a redirection table at the beginning of that shared segment, containing the addresses (to be filled in by the linkage editor) of each routine in the shared library.\nCreate a stub library, that defines symbols for every entry point in the shared library, but implements each as a branch through the appropriate entry in the redirection table. The stub library also includes symbol table information that informs the operating system what shared library segment this program requires.\nLinkage edit the client program with the stub library.\nWhen the operating system loads the program into memory, it will notice that the program requires shared libraries, and will open the associated (sharable, read-only) code segments and map them into the new program’s address space at the appropriate location. This process is described in ld.so(8).\n\n\nFig 7. Virtual Address Space with Shared Libraries\n\nFig 8. Linking Shared Libraries\nIn this way:\n\nA single copy of a shared library implementation (the shared segment) can be shared among all of the programs that use that library.\nThe version of the shared segment that gets mapped into the process address space is chosen, not during linkage editing, but rather at program load time. The choice of which version to use may be controlled by a library path environment variable.\nBecause all calls between the client program and the shared library are vectored through a table, client programs are not affected by changes in the sizes of library routines or the addition of new modules to the library.\nWith correct coding of the stub modules, it is possible for one shared library to make calls into another.\n\nBut there are a few important limitations to this very simple implementation:\n\nThe shared segment contains only read-only code. Routines to be used in this fashion cannot have any static data. Short lived data can be allocated on the stack, but persistent data must be maintained by the client.\nThe shared segment will not be linkage edited against the client program, and so cannot make any static calls or reference global variables to/in the client program.\n\nRoutines to be included in simple shared libraries must be designed with these limitations in mind. It may not be possible to put arbitrary subroutines into a shared library.\nDynamically Loaded Libraries\nShared Libraries are very powerful and convenient, but they too have proved to be too limiting for many applications:\n\nThere may be very large/expensive libraries that are seldom used; Loading/mapping such libraries into the process’ address space at program load time unnecessarily slows down program start-up and increases the memory footprint. In some cases, it might be preferable to delay the loading of a module until it is actually needed.\nWhile loading is delayed until program load time, he name of the library to be loaded must be known at linkage editing time. There are situations (e.g. MIME data types or browser plug-ins) where extensions will be designed and delivered independently from (and subsequent to) the client that exploits them.\n\nThese lead us to Dynamically Loadable Libraries (DLLs): libraries that are not loaded (or perhaps even chosen) until they are actually needed. There are two means by which a Dynamically Loaded Library can become incorporated into a process:\n\nimplicitly: the application may not be aware that references are being resolved from a DLL, but the linkage editor will make provisions for the library to be automatically loaded the first time one of its methods is called.\nexplicitly: the application may choose the library to be loaded (perhaps based on some run-time information like a MIME-type found in a message) and request the operating system to load it for use.\n\nImplicitly Loaded Dynamically Loadable Libraries\nThe client may not be aware that references to external methods are being resolved from a DLL:\n\napplications are linkage edited against a set of stubs, which create (writeable) Program Linkage Table (PLT) entries in the client load module.\nPLT entries are initialized to point to calls to a Run-Time Loader, being passed the name of the desired library and method.\nthe first time one of these entry points is called, the stub calls the Run-Time Loader to open and load the appropriate Dynamically Loadable Library.\nafter the required library has been loaded, the PLT entry is changed to directly call the appropriate entry-point within the newly loaded library.\nall subsequent calls through that PLT entry go directly to the now-loaded routine.\n\nSuch implicitly loaded DLLs are (from the client perspective) almost indistinguishable from statically loaded libraries or shared libraries. Both Dynamically Loadable and shared libraries can reduce the size of load modules (vs. statically linked libraries) and allow a single on-disk/in-memory code segment to be shared by multiple concurrently running programs.\nExplicitly Loaded Dynamically Loadable Libraries\nThe greater functionality and performance benefits of Dynamically Loadable Libraries are only available when the client applications become aware of them:\n\nwhen the client program decides it needs a new library, makes a call to dlopen(3) passing it the name of the desired library (and a few options).\nthe run-time loader will open the desired library, load it into the process' address space, and return a handle that the application can use to access its entry-points.\nwhen the application needs to make calls to some (known) entry point within the DLL, it uses dlsym(void *handle, char *symbol) to get a pointer to the desired entry point, and then makes the calls through those returned pointers.\nif the application later decides that it no longer needs that DLL, it can call dlclose(handle) to unload it from its address space.\n\nExternal References from DLLs\nIn the simplest model the hosting application makes calls into the DLL, but the DLL never uses any information or methods (other than parameters it has been passed) from the hosting application. But many run-time loaders support the ability for DLLs to use the services of other libraries, or even to call global methods or access global information in the hosting application:\n\nIf a DLL needs to reference code/data from other libraries (or the hosting application), the linkage editor will generate PLT entries to facilitate those loading of and linkage to the desired entry points.\nIf a DLL needs to make calls back into the client program (e.g. dynamically loaded device drivers using kernel services) the hosting program can be linkage edited with an option that will make those externally required symbols available to run-time loader calls from the DLL.\n\nShared Libraries are a more efficient mechanism for binding libraries to client applications. Dynamically Loadable Libraries are a mechanism to dynamically extend the functionality of a client application based on resources and information that may not be available until the moment they are needed.\n"},"readings/lec4/cpu-api.html":{"url":"readings/lec4/cpu-api.html","title":"CPU API","keywords":"","body":"CPU API\nThe fork() System Call\n\nKeywords: Process creation, PID, child and parent processes, return values.\nDetails: fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.

But the issues and techniques for addressing those problems apply to a much wider range of divisible, serially reusable resources (e.g. farm land or appointments on a calendar), and so are a valuable foundation for all software developers. Two non-obvious techniques that have evolved (and been widely applied) over the last fifty years are:\n\nGarbage Collection ... seeking out no-longer-in-use resources and recycling them for reuse\nDefragmentation ... reassigning and relocating previously allocated resources to eliminate external fragmentation to create densely allocated resources with large contiguous pools of free space\n\nThese two techniques are, in principle, orthogonal ... but we discuss them together for a few reasons:\n\nboth are techniques for remedying space that has been rendered unusable by unfortunate combinations of allocation events.\nboth are active resource management techniques, where the resource manager is continuously engaged in resource use analysis and reallocation (as opposed to simply responding to client requests).\nthey are often applied in tandem ... start with garbage collection, and then perform defragmentation.\n\nGarbage Collection\nHow does an allocated resource come to be returned to the free pool?\n\nWith many resources, and in many programming languages, allocated resources are freed by an explicit or implicit action on the client's part. Example include:\n\ncalling close(2) on a file\ncalling free(3) on memory obtained from malloc(3)\ninvoking the delete operator on a C++ object\nreturning from a C/C++ subroutine\ncalling exit(2) to terminate a process\n\n\n\n\nIf a resource is sharable by multiple concurrent clients (e.g. an open file or a shared memory segment), we cannot free it simply because one client called close. The resource manager (e.g. the operating system) may maintain a active reference count for each resource:\n\nincrement the reference count whenever a new reference to the object is obtained.\ndecrement the reference count whenever a reference is released (e.g. by calling close).\nautomatically free the object when the reference count reaches zero.\n\n\n\nBut these two approaches are not always practical:\n\nin languages where it is possible to copy resource references (e.g. pointers) references can be copied or destroyed without invoking any operating system services ... and so the OS will not know about these resource references.\nmost programming languages seek to make the programmer's job easier, and keeping track of when which resources are no longer needed can be a lot of work. For this reason, many languages (e.g. Lisp, Java, Python) do not require programs to explicitly free some resources (e.g. memory). This not only reduces developer task loading, but it also eliminates a great many bugs.\nsome resources (e.g. DHCP addresses) may never be explicitly freed, and so must be automatically recycled after they have gone unused for a specified period of time.\nfor some resources, allocation/release operations may be so frequent that the cost of keeping track of them becomes a significant overhead and performance loss.\n\nIn situations like these Garbage Collection is a popular alternative to explicit or reference count based freeing. In such a system ...\n\nresources are allocated, and never explicitly freed\nwhen the pool of available resources becomes dangerously small, the system initiates garbage collection:\nbegin with a list of all of the resources that originally existed.\nscan the process to find all resources that are still reachable.\neach time a reachable resource is found, remove it from the original resource list.\nat the end of the scan, anything that is still in the list of original resources, is no longer referenced by the process, and can be freed.\nafter freeing the unused resources, normal program operation can resume.\n\n\n\nBut Garbage Collection only works if it is possible to identify all active resource references. This might not be possible in an arbitrary program. We could scan all of memory searching for pointers into the allocation heap ... but when we find a heap address in memory, we cannot know if it is a pointer or merely a bit pattern that resembles a pointer. And even if it were clearly a pointer, we cannot know whether or not the program is still going to use it. In languages (or resources) that rely on Garbage Collection the data structures associated with resource references have been designed to be easily enumerated to enable the scan for accessible resources.\nGarbage Collection definitely simplifies the developers job, but (like most things) it comes at a cost: The system may run very nicely for a long time, and then suddenly stop (at unpredictable times) for garbage collection. Clever developers have reduced this problem by creating more complex progressive background garbage collectors that run (relatively) continuously, so that continuous resource freeing can keep up with continuous resource allocation. And, even if background garbage collection is able to keep up with resource allocation demands, it often consumes a lot of cycles and must somehow be synchronized with ongoing allocation operations in the address space it is trying to analyze.\nDefragmentation\nThe second problem to be addressed is external fragmentation. We observed that all variable partition memory allocation algorithms eventually result in a loss of useful storage due to external fragmentation ... the free memory is broken up into disconnected shards, none of which are large enough to be useful. In discussing those algorithms, we observed that coalescing of adjacent free fragments can counter external fragmentation; But coalescing is only effective if adjacent memory chunks happen to be free at the same time. If short-lived allocations are adjacent to a long-lived allocation, or if allocations and deallocations are extremely frequent, there may be very few such opportunities.\nHow important is contiguous allocation?\n\nif we are allocating blocks of disk, the only cost of non-contiguous allocation may be more and longer seeks, resulting in slower file I/O.\nif we are allocating memory to an application that needs to create a single 1024 byte data structure, the program will not work with four discontiguous 256 byte chunks of memory.\nSolid State Disks (based on NAND-Flash technology) may allocate space one 4K block at a time; but before that block can be rewritten with new data it must be erased ... and erasure operations might be performed 64MB at a time.\n\nGarbage Collection analyzes the allocated resources to determine which ones are still in use. Defragmentation goes farther. It actually changes which resources are allocated. Consider two applications of de-fragmentation:\n\n\nFlash Management\nNAND Flash is a pseudo-Write-Once-Read-Many medium. After a block has been written, some serious processing and voltage will be required to erase it before it can be rewritten with new data. When the operating system does a write to an SSD, firmware in the Flash Controller assigns a new block to receive the new data (leaving the old contents no longer referenced). As more and more 4K blocks become stale. Half of all the blocks in the SSD may be available for reuse, but the free blocks are distributed randomly throughout memory.\nTo make those blocks writable again, they must first be erased. But erasure can only be done in large (e.g. 64MB units). Therefore we must:\n\nidentify a 64MB block, many of whose 4K blocks are no longer in use.\ncopy the 4K blocks that are still in use into a new (densely filled) 64MB block, and update the resource allocation maps accordingly.\nwhen no more valid data remains in the large block, it can be erased.\nonce the large block has been erased, all of the 4K blocks within it can be added to the free list for reuse.\n\n\n\n\nDisk Space Allocation\nFile reads and writes can progress orders of magnitude more quickly if logically consecutive blocks are stored contiguously on disk (so they can be read in a single operation with no head movement). But eventually, after many generations of files being created and deleted, the free space, and many files become discontiguous, and the file systems become slower and slower.\nTo clean up the free space and restore our previous performance, we need to follow a process that may seem a little bit like the game Towers of Hanoi, where moving anything seems to (recursively) require moving everything else:\n\nchoose an area of the disk where we want to create contiguous free space and files.\nfor each file in that area, copy it to some other place, to free up space in the area we want to defragment.\nafter all files have been copied out of that area, we can coalesce all the free space into one huge contiguous chunk.\nchoose a set of files to be moved into the newly contiguous free space, and copy them into it.\nrepeat this process until all of the files and free space are contiguous.\n\n\n\n  A graphical illustration of this process can be seen in the \n  Wikipedia article on Defragmentation\nIn neither of these examples is defragmentation a one-time process. Internal fragmentation (like rust) never sleeps! In the first (flash management) example the process is (like progressive garbage collection) a continuous one. In older file systems (e.g. Windows FAT file systems), the process was more likely periodic; Once or twice a year we take the file system down to run defragmentation, after which performance should be good for a few more months. But in some newer file systems (e.g. the B-Tree File System) defragmentation is also a continuously ongoing process.\nConclusions\nIf you write much interesting software, you are likely to find yourself allocating and managing some sorts of divisible, serially reusable resources. Garbage Collection and Defragmentation are sophisticated resource allocation strategies. While the details of how to implement these strategies are highly dependent on the resources to be managed, the general concepts can be applied to a surprisingly wide range of resource allocation problems:\n\nIf it does not make sense, or is not convenient to explicitly free resources, you should consider whether or not Garbage Collection would be a simpler or more efficient solution. If you want to use Garbage Collection, you must figure out how you will make all referenced resources discoverable, how you will trigger the scans, and how you will prevent race conditions between the Garbage Collector and your application.\nIf your resource is subject to degradation or loss due to external fragmentation, you should consider whether or not periodic defragmentation can mitigate that process. If you want to use Defragmentation, you must figure out how you will drive the process, and how you will accomplish the required resource reallocation and copying without disrupting the running applications.\n\n"},"readings/lec6/vm-api.html":{"url":"readings/lec6/vm-api.html","title":"VM API","keywords":"","body":"VM API\nTypes of Memory\n\nKeywords: Stack memory, heap memory, automatic memory, dynamic allocation.\nDetails: Distinguishes between stack (automatic) memory, managed implicitly by the compiler, and heap memory, where allocation and deallocation are explicitly handled by the programmer.\n\nThe malloc() Call\n\nKeywords: malloc(), dynamic allocation, heap memory, size allocation.\nDetails: Introduces malloc() as a fundamental call for allocating memory on the heap, requiring programmers to specify the desired allocation size and manage the allocated memory.\n\nTips for Using sizeof() and malloc()\n\nKeywords: sizeof() operator, dynamic memory allocation, correct usage.\nDetails: Offers tips on correctly using the sizeof() operator with malloc() to allocate memory of the appropriate size, emphasizing the importance of accounting for the right data types and avoiding common mistakes.\n\nThe free() Call\n\nKeywords: free(), deallocating memory, heap management.\nDetails: Discusses the use of free() to deallocate memory previously allocated with malloc(), highlighting the importance of proper memory management to prevent leaks.\n\nCommon Errors in Memory Management\n\nKeywords: Allocation errors, forgetting to free memory, buffer overflow.\nDetails: Identifies common memory management errors, such as failing to allocate memory, not allocating enough memory, forgetting to initialize allocated memory, and incorrectly freeing memory.\n\nSupporting Calls and Tools\n\nKeywords: calloc(), realloc(), memory initialization, resizing memory.\nDetails: Introduces additional memory allocation functions like calloc() for allocation and initialization, and realloc() for resizing previously allocated memory blocks.\n\nUnderlying OS Support\n\nKeywords: brk, sbrk, memory allocation library, system calls.\nDetails: Explains the underlying system calls (brk and sbrk) that support memory allocation libraries, cautioning against their direct use in favor of higher-level library functions.\n\nTools for Memory Debugging\n\nKeywords: gdb, valgrind, memory leak detection, debugging practices.\nDetails: Recommends using debugging tools like gdb for general debugging and valgrind for detecting memory leaks and other memory-related issues, stressing the importance of familiarizing oneself with these tools.\n\nSummary\n\nKeywords: Memory API, allocation best practices, debugging and validation tools.\n\n"},"readings/lec6/vm-freespace.html":{"url":"readings/lec6/vm-freespace.html","title":"VM Free Space Management","keywords":"","body":"VM Free Space Management\nIntroduction to Free-Space Management\n\nKeywords: Free-space management, external fragmentation, malloc, free.\nDetails: Discusses the problem of managing free memory space, especially in the context of variable-sized units.

Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring, but for most purposes our best guess is that the near future will be like the recent past. Unless you have inside information (i.e. references are not random, and you know understand the pattern) it is generally held that there is little profit to be gained from trying to out-smart LRU. The reason LRU works so well is that most programs exhibit some degree of temporal and spatial locality:\n\nif they use some code or data, they are likely to come back to access the same locations again.\nIf they access code or data in a particular page, they are likely to reference other code (or data) in the same vicinity.\n\nBut these are statements about a single program or process. If we are doing Round-Robin time-sharing with multiple processes we give each process a brief opportunity to run, after which we run all the other processes before running it again. With the exception of shared text segments, separate processes seldom access the same pages.\n\nthe most recently used pages in memory belong to the process that will not be run for a long time.\nthe least recently used pages in memory belong to the process that is just about to run again.\nthis destroys strict temporal and spatial locality, as reference behavior becomes periodic (rather than continuous).\n\nIn the absence of temporal and spatial locality, Global LRU will make poor decisions. Global LRU and Round-Robin scheduling are great algorithms, but they do not work well as a team. It might make sense to give each process its own dedicated set of page frames. When that process needed a new page, we would let LRU replace the oldest page in that set. This would be per-process LRU, and that might work very well with Round-Robin scheduling.\nThe concept of a Working Set\nAs we discovered in our discussion of paging:\n\nWe do not need to give each process as many pages of physical memory as appear in the virtual address space.\nWe do not even need to give each process as many pages of its virtual address as it will ever access.\n\nIt is a good thing if a process experiences occasional page faults, and has to replace old (no longer interesting) pages with new ones. What we want to avoid is page faults due to running a process in too little memory. We want to keep the page-faults down to a manageable rate. The ideal mean-time-between-page-faults would be equal to the time-slice length. As we give a process fewer and fewer page frames in which to operate, the page fault rate rises and our performance gets worse (as we spend less time doing useful computation and more time processing page faults).\nThe dramatic degradation in system performance associated with not having enough memory to efficiently run all of the ready processes is called thrashing.\n\nIf we think that we can have 25 processes in the ready queue, then we had better have enough memory for all 25 of those processes.\nIf we only have enough memory to run 15 of those processes, then we should take the other 10 out of the ready queue (e.g. by swapping them out).\nThe improved performance resulting from reducing the number of page faults will more than make up for the delays processes experience while being swapped between primary and secondary storage.\n\nThere is, for any given computation, at any given time, a number of pages such that:\n\nif we increase the number of page frames allocated to that process, it makes very little difference in the performance.\nif we reduce the number of page frames allocated to that process, the performance suffers noticeably.\n\nWe will call that number the process' working set size (at that particular time).\n\nHow large is a working set\nDifferent computations require different amounts of memory. A tight loop operating on a few variables might need only two pages. Complex combinations of functions applied to large amounts of data could require hundreds of thousands of pages. Not only are different programs likely to require different amounts of memory, a single program may require different amounts of memory at different points during its execution.\nRequiring more memory is not necessarily a bad thing ... it merely reflects the costs of that particular computation. When we explored scheduling we saw that different processes have different degrees of interactivity, and that if we could characterize the interactivity of each process we could more efficiently schedule it. The same is true of working set size. We can infer a process' working set size by observing its behavior. If a process is experiencing many page faults, its working set is larger than the memory currently allocated to it. If a process is not experiencing page faults, it may have too much memory allocated to it. If we can allocate the right amount of memory to each process, we will minimize our page faults (overhead) and maximize our throughput (efficiency).\nImplementing Working Set replacement\nRegularly scanning all of memory to identify the least recently used page is a very expensive process. With Global LRU, we saw that a clock-like scan was a very inexpensive way to achieve a very similar affect. The clock hand position was a surrogate for age:\n\nthe most recently examined pages are immediately behind the hand.\nthe pages we examined longest ago are immediately in front of the hand.\nif the page immediately in front of the hand has not be referenced since the last time it has been scanned, it must be very old ... even if it is not actually the oldest page in memory.\n\nWe can use a very similar approach to implement working sets. But we will need to maintain a little bit more information:\n\neach page frame is associated with an owning process\neach process has an accumulated CPU time\neach page frame will have a last referenced time, value, taken from the accumulated CPU timer of its owning process.\nwe maintain a target age parameter ... which is keep in memory goal for all pages.\n\nThe new scan algorithm will be:\n    while ...\n    {\n        // see if this page is old enough to replace\n        owningProc = page->owner;\n        if (page->referenced) {\n            // assume it was just referenced\n            page->lastRef = owningProc->accumulatedTime;\n            page->referenced = 0;\n        } else {\n            // has it gone unreferenced long enough?\n            age = owningProc->accumulatedTime - page->lastRef;\n            if (age > targetAge)\n                return(page);\n        }\n    }\nThe key elements of this algorithm are:\n\nAge decisions are not made on the basis of clock time, but accumulated CPU time in the owning process. Pages only age when their owner runs without referencing them.\nIf we find a page that has been referenced since the last scan, we assume it was just referenced.\nIf a page is younger than the target age, we do not want to replace it ... since recycling of young pages indicates we may be thrashing.\nIf a page is older than the target age, we take it away from its current owner, and give it to a new (needy) process.\n\nIf there are no pages older than the target age, we apparently have too many processes to fit in the available memory:\n\nIf we complete a full scan without finding anything that is older than the target age, we can replace the oldest page in memory. This works, but at the cost of the very expensive complete scan that the clock algorithm was supposed to avoid.\nIf we believe that our target age was well chosen (to avoid thrashing) we probably need to reduce the number of processes in memory.\n\nDynamic Equilibrium to the rescue\nThis is often referred to as a page stealing algorithm, because a process that needs another page steals it from a process that does not seem to need it as much.\n\nEvery process is continuously losing pages that it has not recently referenced.\nEvery process is continuously stealing pages from other processes.\nProcesses that reference more pages more often, will accumulate larger working sets.\nProcesses that reference fewer pages less often will find their working sets reduced.\nWhen programs change their behavior, their allocated working sets adjust promptly and automatically.\n\nThis is a dynamic equilibrium mechanism. The continuously opposing processes of stealing and being stolen from will automatically allocate the available memory to the running processes in proportion to their working set sizes. It does not try to manage processes to any pre-configured notion of a reasonable working set size. Rather it manages memory to minimize the number of page faults, and to avoid thrashing.\n"},"readings/lec7/vm-beyondphys-policy.html":{"url":"readings/lec7/vm-beyondphys-policy.html","title":"Beyond Physical Memory - Policy","keywords":"","body":"Beyond Physical Memory - Policy\nThe Crux of Page Eviction Decisions\n\nKeywords: Memory pressure, page eviction, replacement policy.\nDetails: Explores the dilemma of choosing which pages to evict when free memory is low, a decision governed by the replacement policy.

This is an introduction to the exchange of data between processes.\nSimple Uni-Directional Byte Streams\nThese are easy to create and trivial to use. A pipe can be opened by a parent and inherited by a child, who simply reads standard input and writes standard output. Such pipelines can be used as part of a standard processing model:\n    macro-processor | compiler | assembler > output\nor as custom constructions for one-off tasks:\n    find . -newer $TIMESTAMP | grep -v '*.o' | tar cfz archive.tgz -T -\nAll such uses have a few key characteristics in common:\n\nEach program accepts a byte-stream input, and produces a byte-stream output that is a well defined function of the input.\nEach program in the pipeline operates independently, and is unaware that the others exist or what they might do.\nByte streams are inherently unstructured. If there is any structure to the data they carry (e.g. newline-delimited lines or comma-separated-values) these conventions are implemented by parsers in the affected applications.\nEnsuring that the output of one program is suitable input to the next is the responsibility of the agent who creates the pipeline.\nSimilar results could be obtained by writing the output of each program into a (temporary) file, and then using that file as input to the next program.\n\nPipes are temporary files with a few special features, that recognize the difference between a file (whose contents are relatively static) and an inter-process data stream:\n\nIf the reader exhausts all of the data in the pipe, but there is still an open write file descriptor, the reader does not get an End of File(EOF). Rather the reader is blocked until more data becomes available, or the write side is closed.\nThe available buffering capacity of the pipe may be limited. If the writer gets too far ahead of the reader, the operating system may block the writer until the reader catches up. This is called flow control.\nWriting to a pipe that no longer has an open read file descriptor is illegal, and the writer will be sent an exception signal (SIGPIPE).\nWhen the read and write file descriptors are both closed, the file is automatically deleted.\n\nBecause a pipeline (in principle) represents a closed system, the only data privacy mechanisms tend to be the protections on the initial input files and final output files. There is generally no authentication or encryption of the data being passed between successive processes in the pipeline.\nNamed Pipes and Mailboxes\nA named-pipe (fifo(7)) is a baby-step towards explicit connections. It can be thought of as a persistent pipe, whose reader and writer(s) can open it by name, rather than inheriting it from a pipe(2) system call. A normal pipe is custom-plumbed to interconnect processes started by a single user. A named pipe can be used as a rendezvous point for unrelated processes. Named pipes are almost as simple to use as ordinary pipes, but ...\n\nReaders and writers have no way of authenticating one-another's identities.\nWrites from multiple writers may be interspersed, with no indications of which bytes came from whom.\nThey do not enable clean fail-overs from a failed reader to its successor.\nAll readers and writers must be running on the same node.\n\nRecognizing these limitations, some operating systems have crated more general inter-process communication mechanisms, often called mailboxes. While implementations differ, common features include:\n\nData is not a byte-stream. Rather each write is stored and delivered as a distinct message.\nEach write is accompanied by authenticated identification information about its sender.\nUnprocessed messages remain in the mailbox after the death of a reader and can be retrieved by the next reader.\n\nBut mailboxes still subject to single node/single operating system restrictions, and most distributed applications are now based on general and widely standardized network protocols.\nGeneral Network Connections\nMost operating systems now provide a fairly standard set of network communications APIs. The associated Linux APIs are:\n\nsocket(2) ... create an inter-process communication end-point with an associated protocol and data model.\nbind(2) ... associate a socket with a local network address.\nconnect(2) ... establish a connection to a remote network address.\nlisten(2) ... await an incoming connection request.\naccept(2) ... accept an incoming connection request.\nsend(2) ... send a message over a socket.\nrecv(2) ... receive a message from a socket.\n\nThese APIs directly provide a range of different communications options:\n\nbyte streams over reliable connections (e.g. TCP)\nbest effort datagrams (e.g. UDP)\n\nBut they also form a foundation for higher level communication/service models. A few examples include:\n\nRemote Procedure Calls ... distributed request/response APIs.\nRESTful service models ... layered on top of HTTP GETs and PUTs.\nPublish/Subscribe services ... content based information flow.\n\nUsing more general networking models enables processes to interact with services all over the world, but this adds considerable complexity:\n\nEnsuring interoperability with software running under different operating systems on computers with different instruction set architectures.\nDealing with the security issues associated with exchanging data and services with unknown systems over public networks.\nDiscovering the addresses of (a constantly changing set of) servers.\nDetecting and recovering from (relatively common) connection and node failures.\n\nApplications are forced to choose between a simple but strictly local model (pipes) or a general but highly complex model (network communications). But there is yet another issue: performance. Protocol stacks may be many layers deep, and data may be processed and copied many times. Network communication may have limited throughput, and high latencies.\nShared Memory\nSometimes performance is more important than generality.\n\nThe network drivers, MPEG decoders, and video rendering in a set top box are guaranteed to be local. Making these operations more efficient can greatly reduce the required processing power, resulting in a smaller form-factor, reduced heat dissipation, and a lower product cost.\nThe network drivers, protocol interpreters, write-back cache, RAID implementation, and back-end drivers in a storage array are guaranteed to be local. Significantly reducing the execution time per write operation is the difference between an industry leader and road-kill.\n\nHigh performance for Inter-Process Communication means generally means:\n\nefficiency ... low cost (instructions, nano-seconds, watts) per byte transferred.\nthroughput ... maximum number of bytes (or messages) per second that can be transferred.\nlatency ... minimum delay between sender write and receiver read.\n\nIf we want ultra high performance Inter-Process Communication between two local processes, buffering the data through the operating system and/or protocol stacks is not the way to get it. The fastest and most efficient way to move data between processes is through shared memory:\n\ncreate a file for communication.\neach process maps that file into its virtual address space.\nthe shared segment might be locked-down, so that it is never paged out.\nthe communicating processes agree on a set of data structures (e.g. polled lock-free circular buffers) in the shared segment.\nanything written into the shared memory segment will be immediately visible to all of the processes that have it mapped in to their address spaces.\n\nOnce the shared segment has been created and mapped into the participating process' address spaces, the operating system plays no role in the subsequent data exchanges. Moving data in this way is extremely efficient and blindingly fast ... but (like all good things) this performance comes at a price:\n\nThis can only be used between processes on the same memory bus.\nA bug in one of the processes can easily destroy the communications data structures.\nThere is no authentication (beyond access control on the shared file) of which data came from which process.\n\nNetwork Connections and Out-of-Band Signals\nIn most cases, event completions can be reported simply by sending a message (announcing the completion) to the waiter. But what if there are megabytes of queued requests, and we want to send a message to abort those queued requests? Data sent down a network connection is FIFO ... and one of the problems with FIFO scheduling is the delays waiting for the processing of earlier but longer messages. Occasionally, we would like to make it possible for an important message to go directly to front of the line.\nIf the recipient was local, we might consider sending a signal that could invoke a registered handler, and flush (without processing) all of the buffered data. This works because the signals travel over a different channel than the buffered data. Such communication is often called out-of-band, because it does not travel over the normal data path.\nWe can achieve a similar effect with network based services by opening multiple communications channels:\n\none heavily used channel for normal requests\nanother reserved for out-of-band requests\n\nThe server on the far end periodically polls the out-of-band channel before taking requests from the normal communications channel. This adds a little overhead to the processing, but makes it possible to preempt queued operations. The chosen polling interval represents a trade-off between added overhead (to check for out-of-band messages) and how long we might go (how much wasted work we might do) before noticing an out-of-band message.\n"},"readings/lec8/User-Mode_Threads.html":{"url":"readings/lec8/User-Mode_Threads.html","title":"User-Mode Threads","keywords":"","body":"User-Mode Threads\nUser-Mode Thread Implementation\nIntroduction\nFor a long time, processes were the only unit of parallel computation. There are two problems with this:\n\nprocesses are very expensive to create and dispatch, due to the fact that each has its own virtual address space and ownership of numerous system resources.\neach process operates in its own address space, and cannot share in-memory resources with parallel processes (this was before it was possible to map shared segments into a process' address space).\n\nThe answer to these needs was to create threads. A thread ...\n\nis an independently schedulable unit of execution.\nruns within the address space of a process.\nhas access to all of the system resources owned by that process.\nhas its own general registers.\nhas its own stack (within the owning process' address space).\n\nThreads were added to Unix/Linux as an afterthought. In Unix, a process could be scheduled for execution, and could create threads for additional parallelism. Windows NT is a newer operating system, and it was designed with threads from the start ... and so the abstractions are cleaner:\n\na process is a container for an address space and resources.\na thread is the unit of scheduled execution.\n\nA Simple Threads Library\nWhen threads were first added to Linux they were entirely implemented in a user-mode library, with no assistance from the operating system. This is not merely historical trivia, but interesting as an examination of what kinds of problems can and cannot be solved without operating system assistance.\nThe basic model is:\n\nEach time a new thread was created:\nwe allocate memory for a (fixed size) thread-private stack from the heap.\nwe create a new thread descriptor that contains identification information, scheduling information, and a pointer to the stack.\nwe add the new thread to a ready queue.\n\n\nWhen a thread calls yield() or sleep() we save its general registers (on its own stack), and then select the next thread on the ready queue.\nTo dispatch a new thread, we simply restore its saved registers (including the stack pointer), and return from the call that caused it to yield.\nIf a thread called sleep() we would remove it from the ready queue. When it was re-awakened, we would put it back onto the ready queue.\nWhen a thread exited, we would free its stack and thread descriptor.\n\nEventually people wanted preemptive scheduling to ensure good interactive response and prevent buggy threads from tying up the application:\n\nLinux processes can schedule the delivery of (SIGALARM) timer signals and register a handler for them.\nBefore dispatching a thread, the we can schedule a SIGALARM that will interrupt the thread if it runs too long.\nIf a thread runs too long, the SIGALARM handler can yield on behalf of that thread, saving its state, moving on to the next thread in the ready queue.\n\nBut the addition of preemptive scheduling created new problems for critical sections that required before-or-after, all-or-none serialization. Fortunately Linux processes can temporarily block signals (much as it is possible to temporarily disable an interrupt) via the sigprocmask(2) system call.\nKernel implemented threads\nThere are two fundamental problems with implementing threads in a user mode library:\n\nwhat happens when a system call blocks\nIf a user-mode thread issues a system call that blocks (e.g. open or read), the process is blocked until that operation completes. This means that when a thread blocks, all threads (within that process) stop executing. Since the threads were implemented in user-mode, the operating system has no knowledge of them, and cannot know that other threads (in that process) might still be runnable.\n\nexploiting multi-processors\nIf the CPU has multiple execution cores, the operating system can schedule processes on each to run in parallel. But if the operating system is not aware that a process is comprised of multiple threads, those threads cannot execute in parallel on the available cores.\n\n\nBoth of these problems are solved if threads are implemented by the operating system rather than by a user-mode thread library.\nPerformance Implications\nIf non-preemptive scheduling can be used, user-mode threads operating in with a sleep/yield model are much more efficient than doing context switches through the operating system. There are, today, light weight thread implementations to reap these benefits.\nIf preemptive scheduling is to be used, the costs of setting alarms and servicing the signals may well be greater than the cost of simply allowing the operating system to do the scheduling.\nIf the threads can run in parallel on a multi-processor, the added throughput resulting from true parallel execution may be far greater than the efficiency losses associated with more expensive context switches through the operating system. Also, the operating system knows which threads are part of the same process, and may be able to schedule them to maximize cache-line sharing.\nLike preemptive scheduling, the signal disabling and reenabling for a user-mode mutex or condition variable implementation may be more expensive than simply using the kernel-mode implementations. But it may be possible to get the best of both worlds with a user-mode implementation that uses an atomic instruction to attempt to get a lock, but calls the operating system if that allocation fails (somewhat like the futex(7) approach).\n"},"readings/lec8/threads-api.html":{"url":"readings/lec8/threads-api.html","title":"Threads API","keywords":"","body":"Threads API\nIntroduction to Thread API\n\nKeywords: pthreads, thread creation, control, synchronization.\nDetails: Outlines the purpose of the pthreads library in offering a set of interfaces for creating and managing threads, emphasizing the importance of these APIs in enabling concurrent execution within applications.\n\nThread Creation\n\nKeywords: pthread_create, function pointers, thread attributes.\nDetails: Describes the pthread_create function used to spawn new threads, detailing its parameters including the thread identifier, attributes, the start routine, and the argument to the start routine.

With this implementation, there is no\n       interaction between the types of lock placed by flock() and\n       fcntl(2), and flock() does not detect deadlock.  (Note, however,\n       that on some systems, such as the modern BSDs, flock() and\n       fcntl(2) locks do interact with one another.)\n\n   CIFS details\n       Up to Linux 5.4, flock() is not propagated over SMB.  A file with\n       such locks will not appear locked for remote clients.\n\n       Since Linux 5.5, flock() locks are emulated with SMB byte-range\n       locks on the entire file.  Similarly to NFS, this means that\n       fcntl(2) and flock() locks interact with one another.  Another\n       important side-effect is that the locks are not advisory anymore:\n       any IO on a locked file will always fail with EACCES when done\n       from a separate file descriptor.  This difference originates from\n       the design of locks in the SMB protocol, which provides mandatory\n       locking semantics.\n\n       Remote and mandatory locking semantics may vary with SMB\n       protocol, mount options and server type.  See mount.cifs(8) for\n       additional information.\nSTANDARDS     top\n       BSD.\nHISTORY     top\n       4.4BSD (the flock() call first appeared in 4.2BSD).  A version of\n       flock(), possibly implemented in terms of fcntl(2), appears on\n       most UNIX systems.\n\n   NFS details\n       Up to Linux 2.6.11, flock() does not lock files over NFS (i.e.,\n       the scope of locks was limited to the local system).  Instead,\n       one could use fcntl(2) byte-range locking, which does work over\n       NFS, given a sufficiently recent version of Linux and a server\n       which supports locking.\n\n       Since Linux 2.6.12, NFS clients support flock() locks by\n       emulating them as fcntl(2) byte-range locks on the entire file.\n       This means that fcntl(2) and flock() locks do interact with one\n       another over NFS.  It also means that in order to place an\n       exclusive lock, the file must be opened for writing.\n\n       Since Linux 2.6.37, the kernel supports a compatibility mode that\n       allows flock() locks (and also fcntl(2) byte region locks) to be\n       treated as local; see the discussion of the local_lock option in\n       nfs(5).\nNOTES     top\n       flock() places advisory locks only; given suitable permissions on\n       a file, a process is free to ignore the use of flock() and\n       perform I/O on the file.\n\n       flock() and fcntl(2) locks have different semantics with respect\n       to forked processes and dup(2).  On systems that implement\n       flock() using fcntl(2), the semantics of flock() will be\n       different from those described in this manual page.\n\n       Converting a lock (shared to exclusive, or vice versa) is not\n       guaranteed to be atomic: the existing lock is first removed, and\n       then a new lock is established.  Between these two steps, a\n       pending lock request by another process may be granted, with the\n       result that the conversion either blocks, or fails if LOCK_NB was\n       specified.

If we can ensure that any of the four necessary conditions will never be met, we have created a system where deadlock (involving those resources) is impossible. There are, however, common situations in which:\n\nmutual exclusion is fundamental.\nhold and block are inevitable.\npreemption is unacceptable.\nthe resource dependency networks are imponderable.\n\nFor many such cases, deadlock avoidance may be an easy and effective solution. Consider the following deadlock situation:\n\nmain memory is exhausted.\nwe need to swap some processes out to secondary storage to free up memory.\nswapping processes out involves the creation of new I/O requests descriptors, which must be allocated from main memory.\n\nThe problem, in this case, is not a particular resource dependency graph, but merely that we exhausted a critical resource. There are many similar situations where:\n\nsome process will free up resources when it completes.\nbut the process needs more resources in order to complete.\n\nIn situations like these, it is common to keep track of free resources, and refuse to grant requests that would put the system into a dangerously resource-depleted state. Making such case-by-case decisions to avoid deadlocks is called deadlock avoidance.\nReservations\nDeclining to grant requests that would put the system into an unsafely resource-depleted state is enough to prevent deadlock. But the failure of a random allocation request (in mid-operation) might be difficult to gracefully handle. For this reason, it is common to ask processes to reserve their resources before they actually need them.\nConsider the sbrk(2) system call. It does not actually allocate any more memory to the process. It requests the operating system to change the size of the data segment in the process' virtual address space. The actual memory assignments will not happen until the process begins referencing those newly authorized pages. If we can determine that the requested reservation would over-tax memory, we can return an error from the sbrk system call, which the process can then decide how to handle. If, however, we waited until a page was referenced before we decided we did not have sufficient memory, we might have no alternative but to kill the process.\nThis approach is not limited to memory. For example ...\n\nwe could refuse to create new files when file system space gets low.\nwe could refuse to create new processes if we found ourselves thrashing due to pressure on main memory.\nwe could refuse to create or bind sockets when network traffic saturates our service level agreement.\n\nUnlike malloc(3), these other operations do not tell us how much new resource the process wants to consume. But in each of these cases there is a request (to which we can return an error) before we reach actual resource exhaustion. And it is this failable request that gives us the opportunity to consider, and avoid a resource-exhaustion deadlock.\nOver-Booking\nIn most situations, it is unlikely that all clients will simultaneously request their maximum resource reservations. For this reason, it is often considered relatively safe to grant somewhat more reservations than we actually have the resources to fulfill. The reward for over-booking is that we can get more work done with the same resources. The danger is that there might a demand that we cannot gracefully handle.\n\nAir lines do this all the time ... which is why they occasionally offer cash and free trips to anyone who is willing/able to take a later flight.\nRequired network bandwidth is routinely estimated based on the expected traffic distribution. Such a network might be able to handle 25% more traffic while still maintaining its Service Level Agreements 99.9% of the time.\nIn operating systems, the notion of killing random processes is so abhorrent that most operating systems simply refuse to over-book. In fact, it is common to under-book (e.g. reserve the last 10% for emergency/super-user use).\n\nDealing with Rejection\nWhat should a process do when some resource allocation request (e.g. a call to malloc(3)) fails?\n\nA simple program might log an error message and exit.\nA stubborn program might continue retrying the request (in hope that the problem is transient).\nA more robust program might return errors for requests that cannot be processed (for want of resources), but continue trying to serve new requests (in the hope that the problem is transient).\nA more civic-minded program might attempt to reduce its resource use (and therefore the number of requests it can serve).\n\nThere are many possible responses, and different responses make sense in different situations. But the key here is that, since the allocation request failed with a clean error, the process has the opportunity to try to manage the situation in the most graceful possible way.\n"},"readings/lec11/Health_Monitoring.html":{"url":"readings/lec11/Health_Monitoring.html","title":"Health Monitoring","keywords":"","body":"Health Monitoring\nHealth Monitoring and Recovery\nIntroduction\nSuppose that a system seems to have locked up ... it has not recently made any progress.

Kill a random process? This might break the circular dependency, but would the system continue to function properly after such an action?\nFormal deadlock detection in real systems ...\n\nis difficult to perform\nis inadequate to diagnose most hangs\ndoes not enable us to fix the problem\n\nFortunately there are better techniques that are far more effective at detecting, diagnosing, and repairing a much wider range of problems: health monitoring and managed recovery.\nHealth Monitoring\nWe said that we could invoke deadlock detection whenever we thought that the system might not be making progress. How could we know whether or not the system was making progress? There are many ways to do this:\n\nby having an internal monitoring agent watch message traffic or a transaction log to determine whether or not work is continuing\nby asking clients to submit failure reports to a central monitoring service when a server appears to have become unresponsive\nby having each server send periodic heart-beat messages to a central health monitoring service.\nby having an external health monitoring service send periodic test requests to the service that is being monitored, and ascertain that they are being responded to correctly and in a timely fashion.\n\nAny of these techniques could alert us of a potential deadlock, livelock, loop, or a wide range of other failures. But each of these techniques has different strengths and weaknesses:\n\nheart beat messages can only tell us that the node and application are still up and running. They cannot tell us if the application is actually serving requests.\nclients or an external health monitoring service can determine whether or not the monitored application is responding to requests. But this does not mean that some other requests have not been deadlocked or otherwise wedged.\nan internal monitoring agent might be able to monitor logs or statistics to determine that the service is processing requests at a reasonable rate (and perhaps even that no requests have been waiting too long). But if the internal monitoring agent fails, it may not be able to detect and report errors.\n\nMany systems use a combination of these methods:\n\nthe first line of defense is an internal monitoring agent that closely watches key applications to detect failures and hangs.\nif the internal monitoring agent is responsible for sending heart-beats (or health status reports) to a central monitoring agent, a failure of the internal monitoring agent will be noticed by the central monitoring agent.\nan external test service that periodically generates test transactions provides an independent assessment that might include external factors (e.g. switches, load balancers, network connectivity) that would not be tested by the internal and central monitoring services.\n\nManaged Recovery\nSuppose that some or all of these monitoring mechanisms determine that a service has hung or failed. What can we do about it? Highly available services must be designed for restart, recovery, and fail-over:\n\nThe software should be designed so that any process in the system can be killed and restarted at any time. When a process restarts, it should be able to reestablish communication with the other processes and resume working with minimal disruption.\nThe software should be designed to support multiple levels of restart. Examples might be:\nwarm-start ... restore the last saved state (from a database or from information obtained from other processes) and resume service where we left off.\ncold-start ... ignore any saved state (which may be corrupted) and restart new operations from scratch.\nreset and reboot ... reboot the entire system and then cold-start all of the applications.\n\n\nThe software might also designed be for progressively escalating scope of restarts:\nrestart only a single process, and expect it to resync with the other processes when it comes back up.\nmaintain a list of all of the processes involved in the delivery of a service, and restart all processes in that group.\nrestart all of the software on a single node.\nrestart a group of nodes, or the entire system.\n\n\n\nDesigning software in this way gives us the opportunity to begin with minimal disruption, restarting only the process that seems to have failed. In most cases this will solve the problem, but perhaps:\n\nprocess A failed as a result of an incorrect request received from process B.\nthe operation that caused process A to fail is still listed in the database, and when process A restarts, it may attempt to re-try the same operation and fail again.\nthe operation that caused process A to fail may have been mirrored to other systems, that will also experience or cause additional failures.\n\nFor all of these reasons it is desirable to have the ability to escalate to progressively more complete restarts of a progressively wider range of components.\nFalse Reports\nIdeally a problem will be found by the internal monitoring agent on the affected node, which will automatically trigger a restart of the affected software on that node. Such prompt local action has the potential to fix the problem before other nodes even notice that there was a problem.\nBut suppose a central monitoring service notes that it has not received a heart-beat from process A. What might this mean?\n\nIt might mean that process A's node has failed.\nIt might mean that the process A has failed.\nIt might mean that the process A's system is loaded and the heart-beat message was delayed.\nIt might mean that a network error prevented or delayed the delivery of a heart-beat message.\nIt might mean there is a problem with the central monitoring service.\n\nDeclaring a process to have failed can potentially be a very expensive operation. It might cause the cancellation and retransmission of all requests that had been sent to the failed process or node. It might cause other servers to start trying to recover work-in-progress from the failed process or node. This recovery might involve a great deal of network traffic and system activity. We don't want to start an expensive fire-drill unless we are pretty certain that a process has actually failed.\n\nthe best option would be for a failing system to detect its own problem, inform its partners, and shut-down cleanly.\nif the failure is detected by a missing heart-beat, it may be wise to wait until multiple heart-beat messages have been missed before declaring the process to have failed.\nto distinguish a problem with a monitored system from a problem in the monitoring infrastructure, we might want to wait for multiple other processes/nodes to notice and report the problem.\n\nThere is a trade-off here:\n\nIf we do not take the time to confirm suspected failures, we may suffer unnecessary service disruptions from forcing unnecessary fail-overs from healthy servers.\nIf we mis-diagnose the cause of the problem and restart the wrong components we may make the problem even worse.\nIf we wait too long before initiating fail-overs, we are prolonging the service outage.\n\nThese so-called \"mark-out thresholds\" often require a great deal of tuning. Many systems evolve complex decision algorithms to filter and reconcile potentially conflicting reports to attempt to infer what the most likely cause of of a problem is, and the most effective means of dealing with it.\nOther Managed Restarts\nAs we consider failure and restart, there are two other interesting types of restart to note:\n\nnon-disruptive rolling upgrades\nIf a system is capable of operating without some of its nodes, it is possible to achieve non-disruptive rolling software upgrades. We take nodes down, one-at-a-time, upgrade each to a new software release, and then reintegrate them into the service. There are two tricks associated with this:the new software must be up-wards compatible with the old software, so that new nodes can interoperate with old ones.if the rolling upgrade does not seem to be working, there needs to be an automatic fall-back option to return to the previous (working) release.\n\nprophylactic reboots\nIt has long been observed that many software systems become slower and more error prone the longer they run. The most common problem is memory leaks, but there are other types of bugs that can cause software systems to degrade over time. The right solution is probably to find and fix the bugs ... but many organizations seem unable to do this. One popular alternative is to automatically restart every system at a regular interval (e.g. a few hours or days).If a system can continue operating in the face of node failures, it should be fairly simple to shut-down and restart nodes one at a time, on a regular schedule.\n\n\n"},"readings/lec11/Java_intrinsic_locks.html":{"url":"readings/lec11/Java_intrinsic_locks.html","title":"Java Intrinsic Locks","keywords":"","body":"Java Intrinsic Locks\nIntrinsic Locks and Synchronization\nSynchronization is built around an internal entity known as the intrinsic lock or monitor lock. (The API specification often refers to this entity simply as a \"monitor.\") Intrinsic locks play a role in both aspects of synchronization: enforcing exclusive access to an object's state and establishing happens-before relationships that are essential to visibility.\nEvery object has an intrinsic lock associated with it. By convention, a thread that needs exclusive and consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock before accessing them, and then release the intrinsic lock when it's done with them. A thread is said to own the intrinsic lock between the time it has acquired the lock and released the lock. As long as a thread owns an intrinsic lock, no other thread can acquire the same lock. The other thread will block when it attempts to acquire the lock.\nWhen a thread releases an intrinsic lock, a happens-before relationship is established between that action and any subsequent acquisition of the same lock.\nLocks In Synchronized Methods\nWhen a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the intrinsic lock for that method's object and releases it when the method returns. The lock release occurs even if the return was caused by an uncaught exception.\nYou might wonder what happens when a static synchronized method is invoked, since a static method is associated with a class, not an object. In this case, the thread acquires the intrinsic lock for the Class object associated with the class. Thus access to class's static fields is controlled by a lock that's distinct from the lock for any instance of the class.\nSynchronized Statements\nAnother way to create synchronized code is with synchronized statements. Unlike synchronized methods, synchronized statements must specify the object that provides the intrinsic lock:\npublic void addName(String name) {\n    synchronized(this) {\n        lastName = name;\n        nameCount++;\n    }\n    nameList.add(name);\n}\nIn this example, the addName method needs to synchronize changes to lastName and nameCount, but also needs to avoid synchronizing invocations of other objects' methods. (Invoking other objects' methods from synchronized code can create problems that are described in the section on Liveness.) Without synchronized statements, there would have to be a separate, unsynchronized method for the sole purpose of invoking nameList.add.\nSynchronized statements are also useful for improving concurrency with fine-grained synchronization. Suppose, for example, class MsLunch has two instance fields, c1 and c2, that are never used together. All updates of these fields must be synchronized, but there's no reason to prevent an update of c1 from being interleaved with an update of c2 — and doing so reduces concurrency by creating unnecessary blocking. Instead of using synchronized methods or otherwise using the lock associated with this, we create two objects solely to provide locks.\npublic class MsLunch {\n    private long c1 = 0;\n    private long c2 = 0;\n    private Object lock1 = new Object();\n    private Object lock2 = new Object();\n\n    public void inc1() {\n        synchronized(lock1) {\n            c1++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void inc2() {\n        synchronized(lock2) {\n            c2++;\n        }\n    }\n}\nUse this idiom with extreme care. You must be absolutely sure that it really is safe to interleave access of the affected fields.\nReentrant Synchronization\nRecall that a thread cannot acquire a lock owned by another thread. But a thread can acquire a lock that it already owns. Allowing a thread to acquire the same lock more than once enables reentrant synchronization. This describes a situation where synchronized code, directly or indirectly, invokes a method that also contains synchronized code, and both sets of code use the same lock. Without reentrant synchronization, synchronized code would have to take many additional precautions to avoid having a thread cause itself to block.\n"},"readings/lec11/Java_synchronization.html":{"url":"readings/lec11/Java_synchronization.html","title":"Java Synchronization","keywords":"","body":"Java Synchronization\nSynchronized Methods\nThe Java programming language provides two basic synchronization idioms: synchronized methods and synchronized statements. The more complex of the two, synchronized statements, are described in the next section. This section is about synchronized methods.\nTo make a method synchronized, simply add the synchronized keyword to its declaration:\npublic class SynchronizedCounter {\n    private int c = 0;\n\n    public synchronized void increment() {\n        c++;\n    }\n\n    public synchronized void decrement() {\n        c--;\n    }\n\n    public synchronized int value() {\n        return c;\n    }\n}\nIf count is an instance of SynchronizedCounter, then making these methods synchronized has two effects:\n\nFirst, it is not possible for two invocations of synchronized methods on the same object to interleave. When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods for the same object block (suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.\nSecond, when a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before relationship with any subsequent invocation of a synchronized method for the same object. This guarantees that changes to the state of the object are visible to all threads.\n\nNote that constructors cannot be synchronized — using the synchronized keyword with a constructor is a syntax error. Synchronizing constructors doesn't make sense, because only the thread that creates an object should have access to it while it is being constructed.\n\nWarning: When constructing an object that will be shared between threads, be very careful that a reference to the object does not \"leak\" prematurely. For example, suppose you want to maintain a List called instances containing every instance of class. You might be tempted to add the following line to your constructor:\ninstances.add(this);\nBut then other threads can use instances to access the object before construction of the object is complete.\n\nSynchronized methods enable a simple strategy for preventing thread interference and memory consistency errors: if an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads or writes to that object's variables are done through synchronized methods. (An important exception: final fields, which cannot be modified after the object is constructed, can be safely read through non-synchronized methods, once the object is constructed) This strategy is effective, but can present problems with liveness, as we'll see later in this lesson.\n"},"readings/lec11/threads-bugs.html":{"url":"readings/lec11/threads-bugs.html","title":"Threads - Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Threads - Debugging\nIntroduction to Concurrency Problems\n\nKeywords: Concurrency bugs, deadlock, non-deadlock bugs, common patterns.\nDetails: The document begins with an overview of concurrency bugs, emphasizing the importance of understanding common bug patterns to write robust, concurrent code.\n\nTypes of Concurrency Bugs\n\nKeywords: Atomicity violation bugs, order violation bugs, study by Lu et al., real-world applications.\nDetails: A significant portion of the document is dedicated to discussing the findings of a study by Lu et al., which analyzes concurrency bugs in major open-source applications like MySQL, Apache, Mozilla, and OpenOffice.

Yet despite being implemented in simpler langauges (often C), Operating Systems, in device drivers, offer highly evolved examples of a different realization of class interfaces, derivation, and inheritance.\nWhether we are talking about storage, networking, video, or human-interface, the number of available devices is huge and growing. The number and diversity of these devices creates tremendous demands for object oriented code reuse:\n\nWe want the system to behave similarly, no matter what the underlying devices were being used to provide storage, networking, etc. To ensure this, we would like most of the higher level functionality to be implemented in common, higher level modules.\nWe would like to minimize the cost of developing drivers to support new devices. This is most easily done if the majority of the functionality is implemented in common code that can be inherrited by the individual drivers.\nAs system functionality and performance are improved, we would like to ensure that those benefits accrue not only to new device drivers, but also to older device drivers.\n\nThese needs can be satisfied by implementing the higher level functionality (associated with each general class of device) in common code that uses per-device implementations of a standard sub-class driver to operate over a particular device. This requires:\n\nderiving device-driver sub-classes for each of the major classes of device.\ndefining sub-class specific interfaces to be implemented by the drivers for all devices in each of those classes.\ncreating per-device implementations of those standard sub-class interfaces.\n\nMajor Driver Classes\nIn the earliest versions of Unix, all devices were divided into two fundamental classes, which are still present in all Unix derivatives:\n\nblock devices\nThese are random-access devices, addressable in fixed size (e.g. 512 byte, 4K byte) blocks. Their drivers implement a request method to enqueue asynchronous DMA requests. The request descriptor included information about the desired operation (e.g. byte count, target device, disk address and in-memory buffer address) as well as completion information (how much data was transferred, error indications) and a condition variable the requestor could use to await the eventual completion of the request.A read or write request could be issued for any number of blocks, but in most cases a large request would be broken into multiple single-block requests, each of which would be passed, block at a time, through the system buffer cache. For this reason block device drivers also implement a fsync method to flush out any buffered writes.\n\ncharacter devices\nThese devices may be sequential access, or may be byte-addressable. They support the standard synchronous read(2), write(2) and (indirectly) seek(2) operations.For devices that supported DMA, read and write operations were expected to be done as a single (potentially very large) DMA transfer between the device and the buffers in user address space.\n\n\nA key point here is that, even in the oldest Unix systems, device drivers were divided into distinct classes (implementing different interfaces) based on the needs of distinct classes of clients:\n\nBlock devices were designed to be used, within the operating system, by file systems, to access disks. Forcing all I/O to go through the system buffer cache is almost surely the right thing to do with file system I/O.\nCharacter devices were designed to be used directly by applications. The potential for large DMA transfers directly between the device and user-space buffers meant that character (or raw) I/O operations might be much more efficient than the corresponding requests to a block device.\n\nThese two major classes of device were not mutually exclusive. A single driver could export both block and character interfaces. A file system would be mounted on top of the block device, while back-up and integrity-checking software might access the disk through its (potentially much more efficient) character device. All device drivers support initialize and cleanup methods (for dynamic module loading and unloading), open and release methods (roughly corresponding to the open(2) and close(2) system calls), and an optional catch-all ioctl(2)* method.\n\n*In more contemporary systems, it is possible for a client to specify that block I/O should not be passed through the system buffer cache.\nDriver sub-classes\nGiven the fundamental importance of file systems and disks to operating systems, it is not surprising that block device drivers would have been singled out as a special sub-class in even the earliest versions of Unix. But as system functionality evolved, the operating system began to implement higher level services for other sub-classes of devices:\n\ninput editing and outut translation for terminals and virtual terminals\naddress binding and packet sending/receipt for network interfaces\ndisplay mapping and window management for graphics adaptors\ncharacter-set mapping for keyboards\ncursor positioning for pointing devices\nsample mixing, volume and equalization for sound devices\n\n\nAnd as each of these sub-systems evolved, new device driver methods were defined to enable more effective communication between the higher level frameworks and the lower level device drivers in each sub-class. Each of these sub-class specific interfaces is referred to as a Device Driver Interface* (DDI).\n\n*It should be noted that in some cases, the higher frameworks have been implemented in user-mode, so that some of the new interfaces have been specified as behavior rather than new methods.\nThe rewards for this structure are:\n\nSub-class drivers become easier to implement because so much of the important functionality is implemented in higher level software.\nThe system behaves identically over a wide range of different devices.\nMost functionality enhancements to will be in the higher level code, and so should automatically work on all devices within that sub-class.\n\nBut the price for these rewards is that all device drivers must implement exactly the same interfaces:\n\nif a driver does not (correctly) implement the standard interfaces for its device sub-class, it will not work with the higher level software.\nif a driver implements additional functionality (not defined in the standard interfaces for its device sub-class), those features will not be exploited by the standard higher level software.\n\nServices for Device Drivers\nIt is nearly impossible to implement a completely self-contained device driver. Most device drivers are likely to require a range of resources and services from the operating system:\n\ndynamic memory allocation\nI/O and bus resource allocation and management\ncondition variable operations (wait and signal)\nmutual exclusion\ncontrol of, and being called to service interrupts\nDMA target pin/release, scatter/gather map management\nconfiguration/registry services\n\nThe collection of services, exposed by the operating system for use by device drivers is sometimes referred to as the Driver-Kernel Interface (DKI). Interface stability for DKI functions is every bit as important as it is for the DDI entry points. If an operating system eliminates or incompatibly changes a DKI function, device drivers that depend on that function may cease working. The requirement to maintain stable DKI entry points may greatly constrain our ability to evolve our operating system implementation. Similar issues arrise for other classes of dynamically loadable kernel modules (such as network protocols and file systems).\nConclusion\nDevice drivers demonstrate an evolution from a basic super-class (character devices) into an ever-expanding hierarchy of derived sub-classes. But unlike traditional class derivation, where sub-class implementations inherit most of their implemntation from their parent, we see a different sort of inheritance. While each new sub-class and instance is likely to be a new implementation, what they inherit is pre-existing higher level frameworks that do do most of their work for them.\n"},"readings/lec12/Dynamically_loadable_device_drivers.html":{"url":"readings/lec12/Dynamically_loadable_device_drivers.html","title":"Dynamically Loadable Device Drivers","keywords":"","body":"Dynamically Loadable Device Drivers\nDynamically Loadable Kernel Modules\nIntroduction\nWe often design systems to provide a common framework, but that expect problem-specific implementations to be provided at a later time. This approach is embraced by several standard design patterns (e.g. Strategy, Factory, Plug-In). These approaches have a few key elements in common:\n\nall implementations provide similar functionality in accordance with a common interface.\nthe selection of a particular implementation can be deffered until run time.\ndecoupling the overarching service from the plug-in implementations makes it possible for a system to work with a potentially open-ended set of of algorithms or adaptors.\n\nIn most programs the set of available implementations is locked in at build-time. But many systems have the ability to select and load new implementations at run time as dynamically loadable modules. We see this with browser plug-ins. Operating systems may also support many different types of dynamically loadable modules (e.g., file systems, network protocols, device drivers). Device drivers are a particularly important and rich class of dynamically loadable modules ... and therefore a good example to study.\nThere are several compelling reasons for wanting device drivers to be dynamically loadable:\n\nthe number of possible I/O devices is far too large to build all of them in to the operating system.\nif we want an operating system to automatically work on any computer, it must have the ability to automatically identify and load the required device drivers.\nmany devices (e.g., USB) are hot-pluggable, and we cannot know what drivers are required until the the associated device is plugged in to the computer.\nnew devices become available long after the operating system has been shipped, and so must be after market addable.\nmost device drivers are developed by the hardware manufacturers, and delivered to customers independently from the operating system.\n\nChoosing Which Module to Load\nIn the abstract, a program needs an implementation and calls a Factory to obtain it. But how does the Factory know what implementation class to instantiate?\n\nfor a browser plugin, there might be a MIME-type assocated with the data to be handled, and the browser can consult a registry to find the plug-in associated with that MIME-type. This is a very general mechanism ... but it presumes that data is tagged with a type, and that somebody is maintaining a tag-to-plugin registery.\nat the other extreme, the Factory could load all of the known plug-ins and call a probe method in each to see which (if any) of the plug-ins could identify the data and claim responsibility for handling it.\n\nLong ago, dynamically loadable device drivers used the probing process, but this was both unreliable (might incorrectly accept the wrong device) and dangerious (touching random registers in random devices). Today most I/O busses support self-identifying devices. Each device has type, model, and even serial number information that can be queried in a standard way (e.g., by walking the configuration space). This information can be used, in combination with a device driver registry, to automatically select a driver for a given device. These registries may support precedence rules that can chose the best from among multiple competing drivers (e.g., a generic VGA driver, a GeForce driver, and a GeForce GTX 980 driver).\nLoading a New Module\nIn many cases, the module to be loaded may be entirely self-contained (it makes no calls outside of itself) or uses only standard shared libraries (which are expected to be mapped in to the address space at well known locations). In these cases loading a new module is as simple as allocating some memory (or address space) and reading the new module into it.\nIn many cases (including device drivers and file systems) the dynamically loaded module may need to make use of other functions (e.g., memory allocation, synchronization, I/O) in the program into which it is being added. This means that the module to be loaded will (like an object module) have unresolved external references, and requires a run-time loader (a simplified linkage editor) that can look up and adjust all of those references as the new module is being loaded.\nNote, however, that these references can only be from the dynamically loaded module into the program into which it is loaded (e.g., the operating system). The main program can never have any direct references into the dynamically loaded module ... because the dynamically loaded module may not always be there.\nInitialization and Registration\nIf the operating system is not allowed to have any direct references into a dynamically loadable module, how can the new module be used? When the run-time loader is invoked to load a new dynamically loadable module, it is common for it to return a vector that contains a pointer to at least one method: an initialization function.\nAfter the module has been loaded into memory, the main program calls its initialization method. For a dynamically loaded device driver, the initialization method might:\n\nallocate memory and initialize driver data structures.\nallocate I/O resources (e.g., bus addresses, interrupt levels, DMA channels) and assign them to the devices to be managed.\nregister all of the device instances it supports. Part of this registration would involve providing a vector (of pointers to standard device drvier entry points) that client software could call in order to use these device instances.\n\nDevice instance configuration and initialization is another area where self-identifying devices have made it much easier to implement dynamically loaded device drivers:\n\nLong ago, devices were configured for particular bus addresses and interrupt levels with mechanical switches, that would be set before the card was plugged in to the bus. These resource assignments would be recorded in a system configuration table, which would be compiled (or read during system start-up) into the operating system, and used to select and configure corresponding device driver instances.\nMore contemporary busses (like PCIe or USB) provide mechanisms to discover all of the available devices and learn what resources (e.g., bus addresses, DMA channels, interrupt levels) they require. The device driver can then allocate these resources from the associated bus driver, and assign the required resources to each device.\n\nUsing a Dynamically Loaded Module\nThe operating system will provide some means by which processes can open device instances. In Linux the OS exports a pseudo file system (/dev) that is full of special files, each one associated with a registered device instance. When a process attempts to open one of those special files, the operating system creates a reference from the open file instance to the registered device instance. From then on, when ever the process issues a read(2), write(2), or ioctl(2) system call on that file descriptor, the operating system forwards that call to the appropriate device driver entry point.\nA similar approach is used when higher level frameworks (e.g., terminal sessions, network protocols or file systems) are implemented on top of a device. Each of those services maintains open references to the underlying devices, and when they need to talk to the device (e.g., to queue an I/O request or send a packet) the OS forwards that call to the appropriate device driver entry point.\nThe system often maintains a table of all registered device instances and the associated device driver entry points for each standard operation. When ever a request is to be made for any device, the operating system can simply index into this table by a device identifier to look up the address of the entry point to be called. Such mechanisms for registering heterogenous implementations and forwarding requests to the correct entry point are often referred to as federation frameworks because they combine a set of independent implementations into a single unified framework.\nUnloading\nWhen all open file descriptors into those devices have been closed and the driver is no-longer needed, the operating system can call an shut-down method that will cause the driver to:\n\nun-register itself as a device driver\nshut down the devices it had been managing\nreturn all allocated memory and I/O resources back to the operating system.\n\nAfter which, the module can be safely unloaded and that memory freed as well.\nThe Criticality of Stable Interfaces\nAll of this is completely dependent on stable and well specified interfaces:\n\nthe set of entry-points for any class of device driver must be well defined, and all drivers must compatably implement all of the relevant interfaces.\nthe set of functions within the main program (OS) that the dynamically loaded modules are allowed to call must be well defined, and the interfaces to each of those functions must be stable.\n\nIf one device driver did not implement a standard entry point in the standard way, clients of that device would not work. Some functionality may be optional, and it may be acceptable for a device driver to refuse some requests. But this may make the application responsible for dealing with some version incompatabilities.\nIf an operating system does not implement some standard service function (e.g., memory allocation) in the standard way, a device driver written to that interface standard may not work when loaded into the non-compliant operating system.\nThere is often a tension between the conflicting needs to support new hardware and software features while retaining compatability with old device drivers.\nHot-Pluggable Devices and Drivers\nOne of the major advantages of dynamically loadable modules is that they can be loaded at any time; not merely during start-up. Hot-plug busses (e.g., USB) can generate events whenever a device is added to, or removed from the bus. In many systems a hot-plug manager:\n\nsubscribes to hot-plug events.\nwhen a new device is inserted, walks the configuration space to identify the new device, finds, and loads the appropriate driver.\nwhen a device is removed, finds the associated driver and calls its removal method to inform it that the device is no longer on the bus.\n\nHot-plugable busses often have multiple power levels, and a newly inserted device may receive only enough power to enable it to be queried and configured. When the driver is ready to start using the device, it can instruct the bus to fully power the device. Some hot-pluggable busses also have mechanical safety interlocks to prevent a device from being removed while it is still in use. In these cases the driver must shut down and release the device before it can be removed.\nSummary\nThis discussion has focused on dynamically loadable device drivers, but most of the issues (selecting the module to be loaded, dependencies of the loaded module on the host program, initializing and shutting down dynamically loaded modules, binding clients to dynamically loaded modules, and defining and managing the interfaces between the loaded and hosting modules) are applicable to a much wider range of dynamically loadable modules.\nStable and well standardized interfaces are critical to any such framework:\n\nthe methods to be implemented by the dynamically loaded modules.\nthe services that can be used by the dynamically loaded modules.\n\n"},"readings/lec12/file-devices.html":{"url":"readings/lec12/file-devices.html","title":"File Devices","keywords":"","body":"File Devices\nIntroduction to I/O Devices\n\nKeywords: I/O devices, system integration, efficiency mechanisms.\nDetails: Begins with the fundamental importance of I/O devices in computer systems, posing the crux of how to efficiently integrate I/O into systems.

Introduction\nMany operating systems (including Unix derivatives) attempt to represent all data sources and sinks as files. Files are most commonly discussed as byte streams or one-dimensional arrays, and this is a fair description of much of the file processing done by applications software. But many of those byte-streams contain highly structured data (e.g. a load module, an MPEG-4 video or a database). Some very interesting sources of data (e.g. directories and key-value stores), while serializable, are are not even intended to be processed as byte streams, but with very different APIs. Many files have interesting attributes beyond the data they contain.\nThis is a brief exploration of the range of different types of data that are commonly gathered under the general heading of files.\n2. Ordinary Files\nEven the simplest files are understood by imposing structure and semantics on a binary byte stream:\n\nA text file is a byte stream, but when we process it we generally break it into lines (delimited by \\n or \\r\\n), and render it as characters (e.g. according to the ASCII or ISO 8859 character set).\nAn archive (e.g. zip or tar) is a single file that contains many others. It is an alternating sequence of headers (that describe the next file in the archive) and data blobs (that are the contents of the described file).\nA load module is similar to an archive (in that it is an alternating sequence of section headers and contents) but the different sections represent different parts of a program (code, initialized data, symbol table, ...).\nan MPEG stream is a sequence of audio, video, frames, containing compressed (e.g. Discrete Cosine Transform) program information, which require considerable processing in order to reconstruct the encoded program.\n\nAn ordinary file is just a blob of ones and zeroes. They only have meaning when rendered by a program that understands the underlying data format.\n2.1 Data Types and Associated Applications\nIf a file can only be interpreted by a program that understands the meaning that has been encoded in the byte stream, our first problem is finding the right program to interpret each file (or byte stream). There are a few general approaches:\n\nRequire the user to specifically invoke the correct command to process the data. This is common in Unix-derived systems:\nto edit a file you type vi filename\nto compile a program you type gcc filename\n\n\nConsult a registry that associates a program with a file type:\nthere may be a system-wide registry that associates programs with file types (e.g. Windows).\nthere may be a program-specific registry that associates programs with file types (e.g. configuring browser plug-ins).\nthe owning program may be an attribute of the file (e.g. classic Mac OS).\n\n\n\nA registry solution presupposes that we know what the type of the file is. There are a few approaches to classing files:\n\nThe simplest approach is based on file name suffix (e.g. .c, .png, .txt). This may be simply an organizing convention (e.g. in Unix-derived systems) or a hard-rule (in Windows it may be impossible to process a file that has been renamed to the wrong suffix).\nAnother common approach (very popular with Unix-derived systems) is a magic number at the start of the file. Each type of file (or even file system) begins with a reserved and registered magic number that identifies the file's type. For more information on this approach, look at the file(1) command.\nIn systems that support extended attributes the file type can be an attribute of the file, not dependent on a suffix or magic-number registry.\n\n2.2 File Structure and Operations\nEven ASCII text byte streams have structure, and some streams (e.g. an MPEG-4 video) have a very rich structure. In these cases the file can be viewed as a serialized representation of data that is intended to be viewed by a particular program (e.g. a text editor or video player). It is meaningful to talk about doing read(2) and write(2) operations on these files. But not all files are intended to be accessed via these operations. In some cases, however, the structure of the data is not merely an implementation decision, but fundamental to the manner in which the data is intended to be used:\n\nthe earliest databases were indexed sequential files. These were organized into records, each with a unique index key. While these files could be processed sequentially (one record at a time), it was more common to get and put records based on their keys.\nthese evolved into Relational databases, accessed via Structured Query Languages.\nthe complexity (and non-scalability) of SQL databases gave rise to much simpler (and more scalable) Key-Value Stores accessed only by get, put, and delete operations.\n\nWhile all of these wind up being implemented (usually by some middle-ware layer) on top of byte streams, that is certainly not how they are accessed by their clients.\n3. Other types of files\nIt can be argued that all of the above types of ordinary files are still just blobs of data, differing in their binary representations and the operations in terms of which they are written and read back. But there are other types of files that are not merely blobs of data, to be written and re-read.\n3.1 Directories\nDirectories do not contain blobs of client data. Rather they represent name-spaces, the association of names with blobs of data. They are, in this respect, somewhat similar to key-value stores, but they the namespace is much more highly structured, and the operations are quite different. One very important difference is that a key-value store, as a single file, typically contains data owned by a single user. The namespace implemented by directories includes files owned by numerous users, each of whom wants to impose different sharing/privacy constraints on the access to each referenced file.\nBecause of how important directories are to the system operation and integrity, all directory operations tend to be implemented within the operating system. To ensure the correctness and security of the directory structure there are only a few supported update operations (e.g. mkdir(2), rmdir(2), link(2), unlink(2), create(2) and open(2)), each of which involves considerable permission checking and integrity assurance.\nBut despite these differences, directories exist in same namespace as files, and have the same notions of user/group ownership, and file protection. They can even be accessed (if you know what you are doing) with open(2) and read(2).\n3.2 Inter-Process Communications Ports\nAn inter-process communications port (e.g. a pipe) is not so much a container in which data is stored, as it is a channel through which data is passed. That data is exchanged via write(2) and read(2) system calls on file descriptors that can be manipulated with the dup(2) and close(2) operations. And in the case of named pipes they can be accessed via the open(2) system call.\nWith directories we saw something that was implemented as on-disk byte streams, but accessed with very different operations. With inter-process communications ports, we have something with a very different implementation, but that is accessed (as a byte stream) with normal file I/O operations.\n3.3. I/O Devices\nI/O devices connect a computer to the outside world. Many operating systems put devices in the file namespace. In Unix/Linux systems the special file associated with a device can be anywhere and have any name.\nMany sequential access devices (e.g. keyboards and printers) are fit naturally into the byte-stream read(2)/write(2) model. Other random access devices (e.g. disks) easily fit into a read(2)/write(2)/seek(2) access model. Communications interfaces often behave like byte streams (or perhaps message streams) that also support additional control functions (like controlling line speed, setting MAC address, etc), which we can handle with ioctl(2) operations.\nBut not all I/O devices can be fit into a byte-stream access model. Consider a 3D rendering engine comprised of a few thousand GPUs. Rather than deal with this as a byte stream, we simply map gigabytes of display memory and control registers into our address space and maniuplate them directly. With more primitive devices, we may choose to deal directly with digital and analog signals that sample the state of the external world and control external actuators. Beyond the fact that we used the open(2) system call to get access to them, these devices may bear no relation to persistent byte streams.\n4. File Attributes\nMost of the above have treated files as containers (or access portals) for data. But even a file of ASCII text (e.g. this HTML) is more than than the bytes it contains. In addition to data, files also have meta-data ... data that describes data.\n4.1 System Attributes\nUnix/Linux files all have a standard set of attributes:\n\ntype: regular, directory, pipe, device, symbolic link, ...\nownership: identity of the owning user and owning group\nprotection: permitted access (read, write execute), by the owner, the owning group, and others\nwhen the file was created, last updated, last accessed\nsize (for regular files) ... the number of bytes in the file (which may be sparse).\n\nOther operating systems may support more or different attributes. What is important about this list is:\n\nall files have these attributes\nthe operating system depends on these attributes (e.g. to correctly implement access control)\nthe operating system maintains these attributes\n\n4.2 Extended Attributes\nThere may be other information (beyond the basic system attributes) that is vitally important to correct file processing. Examples might be:\n\nif the file has been encrypted or compressed, by what algorithm(s)?\nif a file has been signed, what is the associated certificate?\nif a file has been check-summed, what is the correct check-sum?\nif a program has been internationalized, where are its localizations?\n\nAll of the above examples are meta-data. They are not part of the file's contents ... but rather descriptive information that may be necessary to properly process the file's contents. There have been two basic approaches taken to supporting extended attributes:\n\nassociate a limited number/size of name=value attributes with each file.\npair each file with one or more shadow files (sometimes called resource forks) that contain additional resources and information.\n\nThe operating system may even need to make use of extended attributes. If we were required to extend Unix/Linux owner/group/other protection to support generalized Access Control Lists we might choose store the additional information in (protected) extended attributes.\n5. Diversity of Semantics\nThe Posix operations for file and directory operations are standardized and relatively universal (although some file systems do not support some types of links). The Posix standards even include a readdir(3) operation for file-system and operating system independent scanning of directories. It is not difficult to write portable software that operates on ordinary files and directories.\nThe operations on and behavior of other types of files (e.g. inter-process communications ports and devices) are not at all standardized.\nWhile the need for extended attributes is widely recognized, there are many different implementations, and not (yet) any widely accepted standard.\n"},"readings/lec13/The_FAT_file_system.html":{"url":"readings/lec13/The_FAT_file_system.html","title":"The FAT File System","keywords":"","body":"The FAT File System\nAn Introduction to DOS FAT Volume and File Structure\nMark Kampe markk@cs.ucla.edu\n1. Introduction\nWhen the first personal computers with disks became available, they were very small (a few megabytes of disk and a few dozen kilobytes of memory). A file system implementation for such machines had to impose very little overhead on disk space, and be small enough to fit in the BIOS ROM. BIOS stands for BASIC I/O Subsystem. Note that the first word is all upper-case. The purpose of the BIOS ROM was to provide run-time support for a BASIC interpreter (which is what Bill Gates did for a living before building DOS). DOS was never intended to provide the features and performance of real timesharing systems.\nDisk and memory size have increased in the last thirty years, People now demand state-of-the-art power and functionality from their PCs. Despite the evolution that the last decades have seen, old standards die hard. Much as European train tracks maintain the same wheel spacing used by Roman chariots, most modern OSs still support DOS FAT file systems. DOS file systems are not merely around for legacy reasons. The ISO 9660 CDROM file system format is a descendent of the DOS file system.\nThe DOS FAT file system is worth studying because:\n\nIt is heavily used all over the world, and is the basis for more modern file system (like 9660).\nIt provides reasonable performance (large transfers and well clustered allocation) with a very simple implementation.\nIt is a very successful example of \"linked list\" space allocation.\n\n2. Structural Overview\nAll file systems include a few basic types of data structures:\n\nbootstrap\ncode to be loaded into memory and executed when the computer is powered on. MVS volumes reserve the entire first track of the first cylinder for the boot strap.\n\nvolume descriptors\ninformation describing the size, type, and layout of the file system ... and in particular how to find the other key meta-data descriptors.\n\nfile descriptors\ninformation that describes a file (ownership, protection, time of last update, etc.) and points where the actual data is stored on the disk.\n\nfree space descriptors\nlists of blocks of (currently) unused space that can be allocated to files.\n\nfile name descriptors\ndata structures that user-chosen names with each file.\n\n\nDOS FAT file systems divide the volume into fixed-sized (physical) blocks, which are grouped into larger fixed-sized (logical) block clusters.\nThe first block of DOS FAT volume contains the bootstrap, along with some volume description information. After this comes a much longer File Allocation Table (FAT from which the file system takes its name). The File Allocation Table is used, both as a free list, and to keep track of which blocks have been allocated to which files.\nThe remainder of the volume is data clusters, which can be allocated to files and directories. The first file on the volume is the root directory, the top of the tree from which all other files and directories on the volume can be reached.\n\n3. Boot block BIOS Parameter Block and FDISK Table\nMost file systems separate the first block (pure bootstrap code) from volume description information. DOS file systems often combine these into a single block. The format varies between (partitioned) hard disks and (unpartitioned) floppies, and between various releases of DOS and Windows ... but conceptually, the boot record:\n\nbegins with a branch instruction (to the start of the real bootstrap code).\nfollowed by a volume description (BIOS Parameter Block)\nfollowed by the real bootstrap code\nfollowed by an optional disk partitioning table\nfollowed by a signature (for error checking).\n\n\n3.1 BIOS Parameter Block\nAfter the first few bytes of the bootstrap comes the BIOS parameter block, which contains a brief summary of the device and file system. It describes the device geometry:\n\nnumber of bytes per (physical) sector\nnumber of sectors per track\nnumber of tracks per cylinder\ntotal number of sectors on the volume\n\nIt also describes the way the file system is laid out on the volume:\n\nnumber of sectors per (logical) cluster\nthe number of reserved sectors (not part of file system)\nthe number of Alternate File Allocation Tables\nthe number of entries in the root directory\n\nThese parameters enable the OS to interpret the remainder of the file system.\n3.2 FDISK Table\nAs disks got larger, the people at MicroSoft figured out that their customers might want to put multiple file systems on each disk. This meant they needed some way of partitioning the disk into logical sub-disks. To do this, they added a small partition table (sometimes called the FDISK table, because of the program that managed it) to the end of the boot strap block.\nThis FDISK table has four entries, each capable of describing one disk partition. Each entry includes\n\nA partition type (e.g. Primary DOS partition, UNIX partition).\nAn ACTIVE indication (is this the one we boot from).\nThe disk address where that partition starts and ends.\nThe number of sectors contained within that partition.\n\n\n\n\nPartn\nType\nActive\nStart (C:H:S)\nEnd (C:H:S)\nStart (logical)\nSize (sectors)\n\n\n\n\n1\nLINUX\nTrue\n1:0:0\n199:7:49\n400\n79,600\n\n\n2\nWindows NT\n\n200:0:0\n349:7:49\n80,000\n60,000\n\n\n3\nFAT 32\n\n350:0:0\n399:7:49\n140,000\n20,000\n\n\n4\nNONE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn older versions of DOS the starting/ending addresses were specified as cylinder/sector/head. As disks got larger, this became less practical, and they moved to logical block numbers.\nThe addition of disk partitioning also changed the structure of the boot record. The first sector of a disk contains the Master Boot Record (MBR) which includes the FDISK table, and a bootstrap that finds the active partition, and reads in its first sector (Partition Boot Record). Most people (essentially everyone but Bill Gates :-) make their MBR bootstrap ask what system you want to boot from, and boot the active one by default after a few seconds. This gives you the opportunity to choose which OS you want to boot. Microsoft makes this decision for you ... you want to boot Windows.\nThe structure of the Partition Boot Record is entirely operating system and file system specific ... but for DOS FAT file system partitions, it includes a BIOS Parameter block as described above.\n4. File Descriptors (directories)\nIn keeping with their desire for simplicity, DOS file systems combine both file description and file naming into a single file descriptor (directory entries). A DOS directory is a file (of a special type) that contains a series of fixed sized (32 byte) directory entries. Each entry describes a single file:\n\nan 11-byte name (8 characters of base name, plus a 3 character extension).\na byte of attribute bits for the file, which include:\nIs this a file, or a sub-directory.\nHas this file changed since the last backup.\nIs this file hidden.\nIs this file read-only.\nIs this a system file.\nDoes this entry describe a volume label.\n\n\ntimes and dates of creation and last modification, and date of last access.\na pointer to the first logical block of the file. (This field is only 16 bits wide, and so when Microsoft introduced the FAT32 file system, they had to put the high order bits in a different part of the directory entry).\nthe length (number of valid data bytes) in the file.\n\n\n\n\nName (8+3)\nAttributes\nLast Changed\nFirst Cluster\nLength\n\n\n\n\n.\nDIR\n08/01/03 11:15:00\n61\n2,048\n\n\n..\nDIR\n06/20/03 08:10:24\n1\n4,096\n\n\nMARK\nDIR\n10/15/04 21:40:12\n130\n1,800\n\n\nREADME.TXT\nFILE\n11/02/04 04:27:36\n410\n31,280\n\n\n\nIf the first character of a files name is a NULL (0x00) the directory entry is unused. The special character (0xE5) in the first character of a file name is used to indicate that a directory entry describes a deleted file. (See the section on Garbage collection below)\nNote on times and dates:\nDOS stores file modification times and dates as a pair of 16-bit numbers:\n\n7 bits of year, 4 bits of month, 5 bits of day of month\n5 bits of hour, 6 bits of minute, 5 bits of seconds (x2).\n\nAll file systems use dates relative to some epoch (time zero). For DOS, the epoch is midnight, New Year's Eve, January 1, 1980. A seven bit field for years means that the the DOS calendar only runs til 2107. Hopefully, nobody will still be using DOS file systems by then :-)\n5. Links and Free Space (File Allocation Table)\nMany file systems have very compact (e.g. bitmap) free lists, but most of them use some per-file data structure to keep track of which blocks are allocated to which file. The DOS File Allocation Table is a relatively unique design. It contains one entry for each logical block in the volume. If a block is free, this is indicated by the FAT entry. If a block is allocated to a file, the FAT entry gives the logical block number of the next logical block in the file.\n5.1 Cluster Size and Performance\nSpace is allocated to files, not in (physical) blocks, but in (logical) multi-block clusters. The number of clusters per block is determined when the file system is created.\nAllocating space to files in larger chunks improves I/O performance, by reducing the number of operations required to read or write a file. This comes at the cost of higher internal fragmentation (since, on average, half of the last cluster of each file is left unused). As disks have grown larger, people have become less concerned about internal fragmentation losses, and cluster sizes have increased.\nThe maximum number of clusters a volume can support depends on the width of the FAT entries. In the earliest FAT file systems (designed for use on floppies, and small hard drives). An 8-bit wide FAT entry would have been too small (256 * 512 = 128K bytes) to describe even the smallest floppy, but a 16-bit wide FAT entry would have been ludicrously large (8-16 Megabytes) ... so Microsoft compromised and adopted 12-bit wide FAT entries (two entries in three bytes). These were called FAT-12 file systems. As disks got larger, they created 2-byte wide (FAT-16) and 4-byte wide (FAT-32) file systems.\n5.2 Next Block Pointers\nA file's directory entry contains a pointer to the first cluster of that file. The File Allocation Table entry for that cluster tells us the cluster number next cluster in the file. When we finally get to the last cluster of the file, its FAT entry will contain a -1, indicating that there is no next block in the file.\n\nThe \"next block\" organization of the FAT means that in order to figure out what physical cluster is the third logical block of a file, must know the physical cluster number of the second logical block. This is not usually a problem, because almost all file access is sequential (reading the first block, and then the second, and then the third ...).\nIf we had to go to disk to re-read the FAT each time we needed to figure out the next block number, the file system would perform very poorly. Fortunately, the FAT is so small (e.g. 512 bytes per megabyte of file system) that the entire FAT can be kept in memory as long as a file system is in use. This means that successor block numbers can be looked up without the need to do any additional disk I/O. It is easy to imagine\n5.3 Free Space\nThe notion of \"next block\" is only meaningful for clusters that are allocated to a file ... which leaves us free to use the FAT entries associated with free clusters as a free indication. Just as we reserved a value (-1) to mean end of file we can reserve another value (0) to mean this cluster is free.\nTo find a free cluster, one has but to search the FAT for an entry with the value -2. If we want to find a free cluster near the clusters that are already allocated to the file, we can start our search with the FAT entry after the entry for the first cluster in the file.\n\n5.4 Garbage Collection\nOlder versions of FAT file systems did not bother to free blocks when a file was deleted. Rather, they merely crossed out the first byte of the file name in the directory entry (with the reserved value 0xE5). This had the advantage of greatly reducing the amount of I/O associated with file deletion ... but it meant that DOS file systems regularly ran out of space.\nWhen this happened, they would initiate garbage collection. Starting from the root directory, they would find every \"valid\" entry. They would follow the chain of next block pointers to determine which clusters were associated with each file, and recursively enumerate the contents of all sub-directories. After completing the enumeration of all allocated clusters, they inferred that any cluster not found in some file was free, and marked them as such in the File Allocation Table.\nThis \"feature\" was probably motivated by a combination of laziness and a desire for performance. It did, however, have an advantage. Since clusters were not freed when files were deleted, they could not be reallocated until after garbage collection was performed. This meant that it might be possible to recover the contents of deleted files for quite a while. The opportunity this created was large enough to enable Peter Norton to start a very successful company.\n6. Descendants of the DOS file system\nThe DOS file system has evolved with time. Not only have wider (16- and 32-bit) FAT entries been used to support larger disks, but other features have been added. The last stand-alone DOS product was DOS 6.x. After this, all DOS support was under Windows, and along with the change to Windows came an enhanced version of the FAT file system called Virtual FAT (or simply VFAT).\n6.1 Long File Names\nMost DOS and Windows systems were used for personal productivity, and their users didn't demand much in the way of file system features. Their biggest complaints were about the 8+3 file names. Windows users demanded longer and mixed-case file names.\nThe 32 byte directory entries didn't have enough room to hold longer names, and changing the format of DOS directories would break hundreds or even thousands of applications. It wasn't merely a matter of importing files from old systems to new systems. DOS diskettes are commonly used to carry files between various systems ... which means that old systems still had to be able to read the new directories. They had to find a way to support longer file names without making the new files unreadable by older systems.\nThe solution they came up was to put the extended filenames in additional (auxiliary) directory entries. Each file would be described by an old-format directory entry, but supplementary directory entries (following the primary directory entry) could provide extensions to the file name. To keep older systems from being confused by the new directory entries, they were tagged with a very unusual set of attributes (hidden, system, read-only, volume label). Older systems would ignore new entries, but would still be able to access new files under their 8+3 names in the old-style directory entries. New systems would recognize the new directory entries, and be able to access files by either the long or the short names.\n\nThe addition of long file names did create one problem for the old directory entries. What would you do if you had two file names that differed only after the 8th character (e.g. datafileread.c and datafilewrite.c)? If we just used the first 8 characters of the file name in the old directory entries (datafile), we would have two files with the same name, and this is illegal. For this reason, the the short file names are not merely the first eight characters of the long file names. Rather, the last two bytes of the short name were merely made unambiguous (e.g. \"~1\", \"~2\", etc).\n6.2 Alternate/back-up FATs\nThe File Allocation Table is a very concise way of keeping track of all of the next-block pointers in the file system. If anything ever happened to the File Allocation Table, the results would be disastrous. The directory entries would tell us where the first blocks of all files were, but we would have no way of figuring out where the remainder of the data was.\nEvents that corrupt the File Allocation Table are extremely rare, but the consequences of such an incident are catastrophic. To protect users from such eventualities, MicroSoft added support for alternate FATs. Periodically, the primary FAT would be copied to one of the pre-reserved alternate FAT locations. Then if something bad happened to the primary FAT, it would still be possible to read most files (files created before the copy) by using the back-up FAT. This is an imperfect solution, as losing new files is bad ... but losing all files is worse.\n6.3 ISO 9660\nWhen CDs were proposed for digital storage, everyone recognized the importance of a single standard file system format. Dueling formats would raise the cost of producing new products ... and this would be a lose for everyone. To respond to this need, the International Standards Organization chartered a sub-committee to propose such a standard.\nThe failings of the DOS file system were widely known by this time, but, as the most widely used file system on the planet, the committee members could not ignore it. Upon examination, it became clear that the most idiomatic features of the DOS file system (the File Allocation Table) were irrelevant to a CDROM file system (which is written only once):\n\nWe don't need to keep track of the free space on a CD ROM. We write each file contiguously, and the next file goes immediately after the last one.\nBecause files can be written contiguously, we don't need any \"next block\" pointers. All we need to know about a file is where its first block resides.\n\nIt was decided that ISO 9660 file systems would (like DOS file systems) have tree structured directory hierarchies, and that (like DOS) each directory entry would describe a single file (rather than having some auxiliary data structure like and I-node to do this). 9660 directory entries, like DOS directory entries, contain:\n\nfile name (within the current directory)\nfile type (e.g. file or directory)\nlocation of the file's first block\nnumber of bytes contained in the file\ntime and date of creation\n\nThey did, however, learn from DOS's mistakes:\n\nRealizing that new information would be added to directory entries over time, they made them variable length. Each directory entry begins with a length field (giving the number of bytes in this directory entry, and thus the number of bytes until the next directory entry).\nRecognizing the need to support long file names, they also made the file name field in each entry a variable length field.\nRecognizing that, over time, people would want to associate a wide range of attributes with files, they also created a variable length extended attributes section after the file name. Much of this section has been left unused, but they defined several new attributes for files:\nfile owner\nowning group\npermissions\ncreation, modification, effective, and expiration times\nrecord format, attributes, and length information\n\n\n\nBut, even though 9660 directory entries include much more information than DOS directory entries, it remains that 9660 volumes resemble DOS file systems much more than they resemble any other file system format. And so, the humble DOS file system is reborn in a new generation of products.\n7. Summary\nDOS file systems are very simple, They don't support multiple links to a file, or symbolic links, or even multi-user access control. They are also and very economical in terms of the space they take up. Free block lists, and file block pointers are combined into a single (quite compact) File Allocation Table. File descriptors are incorporated into the directory entries. And for all of these limitations, they are probably the most widely used file system format on the planet. Despite their primitiveness, DOS file systems were used as the basis for much newer CD ROM file system designs.\nWhat can we infer from this? That most users don't need a lot of fancy features, and that the DOS file system (primitive as it may be) covers their needs pretty well.\nIt is also noteworthy that when Microsoft was finally forced to change the file system format to get past the 8.3 upper case file name limitations, they chose to do so with a kludgy (but upwards compatible) solution using additional directory entries per file. The fact that they chose such an implementation clearly illustrates the importance of maintaining media interchangeability with older systems. This too is a problem that all (successful) file systems will eventually face.\n8. References\nDOS file system information\n\n\nPC Guide's Overview of DOS FAT file systems.

The world-wide web is an obvious and compelling example of the value that is created when people can easily expose and exchange information. Much of the work we do is done in collaboration with others, and so we need often need to share work products. But there are several other powerful forces driving us towards distributed systems.\nClient/Server Usage Model\nLong ago, all the equipment I needed to use in connection with my computer was connected to my computer. But this does not always make sense:\n\nI may only use a high resolution color scanner for a few minutes per month.\nI may make regular use of a high speed color printer, but not enough to justify buying one just for myself.\nI could store my music and videos on my own computer, but if I store them on a home NAS server, the entire family can have access to our combined libraries.\nI could store all my work related files on my own computer, but if I store them on a work-group server, somebody else will manage the back-ups, and ensure that everyone on the project has access to them.\n\nThere are many situations where we can get better functionality and save money by using remote/centralized resources rather than requiring all resources to be connected to a client computer.\nReliability and Availability\nAs we come to depend more and more on our digital computers and storage we require higher reliability and availability from them. Long ago people tried to improve reliability by building systems out of the best possible components. But, as with RAID, we have learned that we can obtain better reliability by combining multiple (very ordinary systems). If we have more computing and storage capacity than we actually need, we may be able to continue providing service, even after one or more of our servers have failed.\nThe key is to distribute service over multiple independent servers. The reason they must be independent is so that they have no single point of failure ... no single component whose failure would take out multiple systems. If the client and server instances are to be distributed across multiple independent computers, then we are building a distributed system.\nScalability\nIt is common to start any new project on a small system. If the system is successful, we will probably add more work to it over time. This means we will need more storage capacity, more network bandwidth, and more computing power. System manufacturers would be delighted if, each time we needed more capacity and power, we bought a new (larger, more expensive) computer (and threw away the old one). But\n\nThis is highly inefficient, as we are essentially throwing away old capacity in order to buy new capacity.\nIf we are successful, our needs for capacity and power will eventually exceed even the largest computer.\n\nA more practical approach would be to design systems that can be expanded incrementally, by adding additional computers and storage as they were needed. And, again, if our growth plan is to scale-out (rather than scale-up) we are going to be building our system out of multiple independent computers, and so we are building a distributed system.\nFlexibility\nWe may start building and testing all the parts of a new service on a notebook or desktop, but later we may decide that we need to run different parts on different computers, or a single part on multiple computers. If our the components of our service interact with one-another through network protocols, it will likely be very easy to change the deployment model (which services run on which computers). Distributed systems tend to be very flexible in this respect.\nChallenges: Why are Distributed Systems Hard to Build\nThe short answer is that there are two reasons:\n\nMany solutions that work on single systems, do not work in distributed systems.\nDistributed systems have new problems that were never encountered in single systems.\n\nNew and More Modes of Failure\nIf something bad happens to a single system (e.g. the failure of a disk or power supply) the whole system goes down. Having all the software fail at the same time is bad for service availability, but we don't have to worry about how some components can continue operating after others have failed. Partial failures are common in distributed systems:\n\none node can crash while others continue running\noccasional network messages may be delayed or lost\na switch failure may interrupt communication between some nodes, but not others\n\nDistributed systems introduce many new problems that we might never have been forced to address in single systems:\n\nIn a single system it may be very easy to tell that one of the service processes has died (e.g. the process exited with a fatal signal or error return code). In a distributed system our only indication that a component has failed might be that we are no longer receiving messages from it. Perhaps it has failed, or perhaps it is only slow, or perhaps the network link has failed, or perhaps our own network interface has failed. Problems are much more difficult to diagnose in a distributed system, and if we incorrectly diagnose a problem we are likely to choose the wrong solution.\nIf we expect a distributed system to continue operating despite the failures of individual components, all of the components need to be made more robust (eg. greater error checking, automatic fail-over, recovery and connection reestablishment). One particularly tricky part of recovery is how to handle situations where a failed component was holding resource locks. We must find some way of recognizing the problem and breaking the locks. And after we have broken the locks we need some way of (a) restoring the resource to a clean state and (b) preventing the previous owner from attempting to continue using the resource if he returns.\n\nComplexity of Distributed State\nWithin a single computer system all system resource updates are correctly serialized and we can:\n\nplace all operations on a single time-time (a total ordering)\nat any moment, say what the state of every resource in the system is.\n\nNeither of these is true in a distributed system:\n\nDistinct nodes in a distributed system operate completely independently of one-another. Unless operations are performed by message exchanges, it is generally not possible to say whether a particular operation on node A happened before or after a different operation on node B. And even when operations are performed via message exchanges, two nodes may disagree on the relative ordering of two events (depending on the order in which each node received the messages).\nBecause of the independence of parallel events, different nodes may at any given instant, consider a single resource to be in different states. Thus a resource does not actually have a single state. Rather its state is a vector of the state that the resource is considered to be in by each node in the system.\n\nIn single systems, when we needed before-or-after atomicity, we created a single mutex (perhaps in the operating system, or in memory shared by all contending threads). A similar effect can be achieved by sending messages to a central coordinator ... except that those messages are roughly a million times as expensive as operations on an in-memory mutex. This means that serialization approaches that worked very well in a single system can become prohibitively expensive in a distributed system.\nComplexity of Management\nIn a single computer system has a single configuration. A thousand different systems may each be configured differently:\n\nthey may have different databases of known users\ntheir services may be configured with different options\nthey may have different lists of which servers perform which functions\ntheir switches may be configured with different routing and fire-wall rules\n\nAnd even if we create a distributed management service to push management updates out to all nodes:\n\nsome nodes may not be up when the updates are sent, and so not learn of them\nnetworking problems may create isolated islands of nodes that are operating with a different configuration\n\nMuch Higher Loads\nOne of the reasons we build distributed systems is to handle increasing loads. Higher loads often uncover weaknesses that had never caused problems under lighter loads. When a load increases by more than a power of ten, it is common to discover new bottlenecks. More nodes mean more messages, which may result in increased overhead, and longer delays. Increased overhead may result in poor scaling, or even in performance that drops as the system size grows. Longer (and more variable) delays often turn up race-conditions that had previously been highly unlikely.\nHeterogeneity\nIn a single computer system, all of the applications:\n\nare running on the same instruction set architecture\nare running on the same version of the same operating system\nare using the same versions of the same libraries\ndirectly interact with one-another through the operating system\n\nIn a distributed system, each node may be:\n\na different instruction set architecture\nrunning a different operating system\nrunning different versions of the software and protocols\n\nand the components interact with one-another through a variety of different networks and file systems. The combinatorics and constant evolution of possible component versions and interconnects render exhaustive testing impossible. These challenges often give rise to interoperability problems and unfortunate interactions that would never happen in a single (homogeneous) system.\nEmergent phenomena\nThe human mind renders complex systems understandable by constructing simpler abstract models. But simple models (almost by definition) cannot fully capture the behavior of a complex system. Complex systems often exhibit emergent behaviors that were not present in the constituent components, but arise from their interactions at scale (e.g. delay-induced oscillations in under-damped feed-back loops). If these phenomena do not happen in smaller systems, we can only learn about them through (hard) experience.\nPeter Deutsch's \"Seven Fallacies\" of Distributed Computing\nIn 1994, Peter Deutsch looked back at a decade of failed distributed computing projects and attempted to distill lessons. He came to the conclusion that many projects had failed because of a few naive assumptions that proved to be disastrously false. He enumerated them in an often cited paper:\n\n\nThe network is reliable.\n\nSubroutine calls always happen. Messages and responses are not guaranteed to be delivered.\n\n\nLatency is zero.\n\nThe time to make a subroutine call is negligible. The time for a a message exchange can easily be 1,000,000X greater.\n\n\nBandwidth is Infinite.\n\nIn-memory data copies can be performed at phenomenal rates. Network throughput is limited, and large numbers of clients can easily saturate NICs, switches and WAN links.\n\n\nThe network is secure.\n\nWhile not perfect, operating systems are sufficiently well protected that we (relatively) seldom have to worry about malicious attacks within our own computer. Once we put a computer on a network it becomes susceptible to penetration attempts, man-in-the-middle attacks, and denial-of-service attacks.\n\n\nTopology does not change.\n\nIn a distributed system, routes change and new clients/servers appear and disappear continuously. Distributed applications must be able to deal with an ever-changing set of connections to an ever-changing set of partners.\n\n\nThere is one administrator.\n\nThere may not be a single database of all known clients. Different systems may be administered with different privileges. Independently managed routers and firewalls may block some messages to/from some clients.\n\n\nTransport cost is zero.\n\nNetwork infrastructure is not free, and the capital and operational costs of equipment and channels to transport all of our data can dramatically increase the cost of a proposed service.\n\n\nAnd, not in Deutsch's original list, but added shortly thereafter ...\n\n\nThe network is homogenous.\n\nNodes on the network are running different versions, of different operating systems, on machines with different Instruction Set Architectures, word lengths, and byte orders, whose users speak different languages, use different character sets, and have very different means of representing even very standard information (e.g. dates).\n\n\n"},"readings/lec18/Leases.html":{"url":"readings/lec18/Leases.html","title":"Leases","keywords":"","body":"Lease-Based Serialization\nSolutions developed for single systems often prove inadequate to embrace the added complexities of distributed systems. This is certainly the case with critical-section synchronization in systems with distributed actors. Leases represent a very different, and much more robust approach to serialization.\nChallenges of Distributed Locking\nAmong Deutsch's Seven Fallacies of distributed computing were:\n\nzero latency\nreliable delivery\nstable topology\nconsistent management\n\nLocking operations in distributed systems run afoul of all of these:\n\nIn a single node, a compare-and-swap mutex operation might take many tens of nanoseconds. Obtaining a lock through message exchange will likely take at least tens of milliseconds. That is a minimum one-million-X difference in performance.\nIn a single node, a mutex operation (whether implemented with atomic instructions or system calls) is guaranteed to complete (tho perhaps unsuccessfully). In a distributed system the request or response could be lost.\nWhen a single node crashes, it takes all of its applications down with it, and when they restart, all locks will be re-acquired. In a distributed system the node holding the lock can crash without releasing it, and all the other actors will hang indefinitely waiting for a release that will never happen.\nIf a process dies, the OS knows it, and has the possibility of automatically releasing all locks held by that process. If the OS dies, all lock-holding processes will also die, and nobody will have to cope with the fact that the OS no longer knows who holds what locks. When a node dies in a distributed system, there is no meta-OS to observe the failure and perform the cleanup. If the failed node happens to be the lock-manager, the remaining clients may find that their locks have been \"forgotten\".\n\nOther issues include:\n\nIn a single node it was possible to use some combination of atomic instructions and interrupt disables to prevent parallelism within critical sections. There are no WAN-scale atomic instructions or interrupt disables.\nIn a single system, we might understand the resources well enough to be able to assign a total ordering to all resources, and so prevent circular dependencies (and thereby deadlocks). In a distributed system the set of possible resources may not be orderable, or even known, which eliminates ordering as a practical means of deadlock prevention.\n\nAddressing these Challenges\nDistributed consensus and multi-phase commits are extremely complex processes, probably far to expensive to be used for every locking operation. It is much easier and more efficient to simply send all locking requests (as messages) to a central server, who will implement them with (simple, efficient, reliable) local locks.\nThe more complex failure cases and greater deadlock risks can be dealt with by replacing locks with leases. A lock grants the owner exclusive access to a resource until the owner releases it. A lease grants the owner exclusive access to a resource until the owner releases it or the lease duration expires.\nIn principle, for normal operation a lease works the same as a lock. Someone who wants exclusive access to a resource requests the lease. As soon as the resource becomes available, the lease is granted, and the requestor can use the resource. When the requestor is done, the lease is released and available for a new owner. But in practice, there is one other very important difference: Locks work on an honor system. An actor who does not yet have a lock will not enter the critical section that the lock protects. Leases are often enforced. When a request is sent to a remote server to perform some operation (e.g. update a record in a database), that request includes a copy of the requestor's lease. If the lease has expired, the responding resource manager will refuse to accept the request. It does not matter why a lease may have expired:\n\nthe release message was lost in transit\nthe owning process has crashed\nthe node on which the owner was running has crashed\nthe owning process is running slowly\nthe network connection to the owning node has failed\n\nWhatever the reason for the expiration, the lease is no longer valid, operations from the previous owner will no longer be accepted, and the lease can be granted to a new requestor. This means that the system can automatically recover from any failure of the lease-holder (including deadlock). But we do have (at least) two issues:\n\nAn expired lease prevents the previous owner from performing any further operations on the protected resource. But if the tardy owner was part-way through a multi-update transaction, the object may be left in an inconsistent state. If an object is subject to such inconsistencies, updates should be made in all-or-none transactions. If a lease expires before the operation is committed, the resource should fall back to its last consistent state.\nThe choice of the lease period may involve some careful tuning. If the lease period is short, an owner may have to renew it many times to complete a session. If the lease period is long, it may take the system a long time to recover from a failure.\n\nSending a network message for every entry into a short critical section would be disastrous. On the other hand, using leases for long lived resources (like DHCP allocated IP addresses) can be extremely economical. It comes down to:\n\nthe number of operations that can be performed under a single lease-grant\nthe ratio of the costs of obtaining the lease to the costs of the operations that will be performed under that lease\n\nA three second delay to obtain an IP address is trivial if the IP address can be used for 24 hours thereafter. A one second delay to get a lock on a file might amortize down to nothing if we could then use that lock to do one million writes.\nEvaluating Leases\n\nMutual Exclusion\nLeases are at least as good as locks, with the additional benefit of potential enforcement.\n\nFairness\nThis depends on the policies implemented by the remote lock manager, who could easily implement either queued or prioritized requests.\n\nPerformance\nRemote operations are, by their very nature expensive ... but we probably aren't going to network leases for local objects. If lease requests are rare and cover large numbers of operations, this can be a very efficient mechanism.\n\nProgress\nThe good news is that automatic preemption makes leases immune to deadlocks! But, if a lease-holder dies, other would-be lessees must wait for the lease period to expire.\n\nRobustness\nThis was never mentioned as a criterion when we were evaluating single system synchronization mechanisms, but leases are clearly more robust than those single-system mechanisms.\n\n\nLeases are not without their problems:\n\nwhile they easily recover from client failures, correct (highly stateful) recovery from lock-server failures is extremely complex.\nautomatic lease expiration is a very powerful feature, but it raises the issue of how to decide \"what time it is\" in a distributed system without a universal time standard.\n\nThese are interesting problems, with interesting solutions, but well beyond the scope of this introductory course.\nOpportunistic Locks\nFor most resources, contention is rare, and the locking code is there only to ensure correct behavior in unlikely situations. It seems unfair to have to pay the high cost of remote lock requests to deal with an unlikely problem. The CIFS protocol supports opportunistic locks. A requestor can ask for a long term lease, enabling that node to handle all future locking as a purely local operation. If another node requests access to the resource, the lock manager will notify the op-lock owner that the lease has been revoked, and subsequent locking operations will have to be dealt with through the centralized lock manager.\nSummary\nLocks are a fundamental concept, but one from a simpler time. They are ignorant of Deutsch's Seven Fallacies, and do not work well in distributed systems. Leases are a richer and more expensive mechanism that more robustly embraces these more complex situations. These capabilities make them interesting even in single-node applications where locking must be robust in the face of an ever-changing set of clients.\n"},"readings/lec18/dist-intro.html":{"url":"readings/lec18/dist-intro.html","title":"Introduction to Distributed Systems","keywords":"","body":"Distributed Systems and Their Challenges\n\nKeywords: Distributed systems, failure management, machine cooperation, web services.\nDetails: The document begins with an overview of distributed systems, highlighting how modern web services like Google or Facebook rely on the cooperation of thousands of machines to provide reliable services.

It aimed to design a distributed file system that could support as many clients as possible, emphasizing efficient protocol design between clients and servers to achieve this scalability.\n\nAFS Version 1\n\nKeywords: AFSv1, whole-file caching, local disk caching, protocol messages.\nDetails: AFS version 1 (AFSv1) introduced whole-file caching on the client's local disk, where opening a file fetches its entire content from the server and caches it locally. This approach differed from NFS's block-level caching and aimed to reduce server interaction by servicing subsequent read and write operations locally, thereby increasing efficiency.\n\nChallenges with AFSv1\n\nKeywords: Path-traversal costs, TestAuth protocol messages, scalability issues.\nDetails: The initial version of AFS faced scalability challenges due to high path-traversal costs and frequent TestAuth protocol messages, which overloaded the server by requiring frequent checks for cached content validity.\n\nAFS Version 2 (AFSv2) Improvements\n\nKeywords: Callback mechanism, file identifiers (FIDs), protocol redesign.\nDetails: AFSv2 addressed scalability issues by introducing a callback mechanism, where the server promises to inform a client if a cached file is modified, and using file identifiers (FIDs) instead of pathnames to specify files. This significantly reduced the number of client-server interactions and path traversal overheads, enhancing scalability.\n\nCache Consistency\n\nKeywords: Cache consistency, update visibility, cache staleness, callback recall.\nDetails: AFSv2 ensured cache consistency by making updates visible when a file is closed and immediately invalidating cached copies on other clients. This approach, alongside the callback mechanism, provided a straightforward and effective cache consistency model.\n\nCrash Recovery\n\nKeywords: Crash recovery, callback recall, cache validity, server recovery.\nDetails: The document discusses the complexities of crash recovery in AFS, including handling missed callback recall messages and ensuring cache validity after a crash. Server recovery involves ensuring all clients are aware of the crash to prevent access to stale cached files.\n\nScale and Performance of AFSv2\n\nKeywords: Scalability, performance, local disk cache, NFS comparison.\nDetails: With the improvements in AFSv2, the system could support more clients per server and offered performance benefits by leveraging local disk caches for frequently accessed files, making file access times comparable to local disk access for cached files.\n\nSummary\n\nKeywords: Distributed file systems, AFS protocol design, scalability, cache consistency.\n\n"},"readings/lec19/dist-nfs.html":{"url":"readings/lec19/dist-nfs.html","title":"Network File System (NFS)","keywords":"","body":"NFS and Distributed File Systems\n\nKeywords: Distributed file systems, client/server model, data sharing.\nDetails: NFS allows multiple client machines to access data stored on a server's disks through a well-defined protocol, facilitating easy data sharing across clients and centralized data management.\n\nBuilding a Distributed File System\n\nKeywords: Key considerations, protocol design, access transparency.\nDetails: The document outlines critical considerations in building a distributed file system, such as ensuring transparency where clients access remote files as if they were local, and the importance of designing efficient protocols for client-server communication.\n\nThe NFS Protocol\n\nKeywords: Stateless operations, protocol messages, file handles.\nDetails: NFS employs a stateless protocol where each client operation contains all information needed to complete the request, significantly simplifying crash recovery by allowing the server to quickly restart and resume operations without needing to rebuild state.\n\nServer Crash Recovery\n\nKeywords: Stateless design, fast recovery, client retries.\nDetails: The stateless nature of NFS enables simple and fast recovery from server crashes. Clients can retry requests without concern for the server's previous state, facilitating robustness against failures.\n\nKey to Fast Crash Recovery: Statelessness\n\nKeywords: No client tracking, protocol requests, crash resilience.\nDetails: NFS achieves fast crash recovery by maintaining a stateless server that doesn't track client actions. This design decision allows for efficient request handling and straightforward recovery mechanisms after crashes.\n\nNFSv2 Protocol and File Handles\n\nKeywords: NFSv2, simple protocol design, file access, unique identifiers.\nDetails: The document focuses on NFSv2, noting its design centered around simplicity and fast server crash recovery. It introduces file handles as unique identifiers for files and directories, essential for stateless operation and efficient request processing.\n\nClient-Side Caching and Cache Consistency\n\nKeywords: Performance, client-side caching, consistency challenges.\nDetails: NFSv2 addresses performance and cache consistency through client-side caching of file data and metadata, implementing strategies like flush-on-close to ensure updates are visible across clients and using attribute caching to minimize server queries.\n\nPerformance Improvements and Challenges\n\nKeywords: Caching, update visibility, stale cache problem, attribute cache.\nDetails: Despite its benefits, client-side caching introduces challenges like ensuring update visibility and avoiding stale caches. NFSv2 uses mechanisms like attribute caching to address these issues, although it leads to complexities in guaranteeing file version consistency.\n\nSummary\n\nKeywords: NFSv2, distributed file system, stateless design, cache consistency.\n\n"},"readings/ppt.html":{"url":"readings/ppt.html","title":"PPT","keywords":"","body":"keywords\nLec1 \n\ninteroperability, separate policy, instruction set architectures (ISA), binary\n\nLec2\n\nabstraction, SCSI standard, graceful transition, subroutine, bind-time, system daemons, middleware\n\nLec3\n\nAPI, portability, ABI, binary compatibility, interoperability, coherence, atomicity, federation, framework\n\nLec4\n\nBSS, sbrk, PCB, supervisor-mode stack, process descriptor, PC, PS, SP, fork, copy-on-write, trap, blocking\n\nLec5\n\nSLA, dispatching, preemptive, throughout, delay, load curve, FCFS, FIFO, priority scheduling, MLFQ\n\nLec6\n\nmemory, RAM, transparency, efficiency, isolation, partition, relocation, fragmentation, coalescing, buffer pool\n\nLec7\n\nswapping, RAM, paging, page frame, MMU, TANSTAAFL, locality, oracle, LRU, clock, thrashing\n\n"}}}
